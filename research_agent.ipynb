Jiang, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Antoine Roux, Arthur Mensch, Blanche Savary, Chris Bamford, Devendra Singh Chaplot, Diego de las Casas, Emma Bou Hanna, Florian Bressand, Gianna Lengyel, Guillaume Bour, Guillaume Lample, LÃ©lio Renard Lavaud, Lucile Saulnier, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Pierre Stock, Sandeep Subramanian, Sophia Yang, Szymon Antoniak, Teven Le Scao, ThÃ©ophile Gervet, Thibaut Lavril, Thomas Wang, TimothÃ©e Lacroix, William El Sayed Abstract We introduce Mixtral 8x7B, a Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) language model. Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine- tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B â Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B â chat model on human bench- marks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.',\n",

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine- tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B â Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B â chat model on human bench- marks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.'),\n",

This technique increases the number of parameters of a model while controlling cost and latency, as the model only uses a fraction of the total set of parameters per token. Mixtral is pretrained with multilingual data using a context size of 32k tokens. It either matches or exceeds the performance of Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5, over several benchmarks. In particular, Mixture of Experts Layer i gating inputs af outputs router expert Figure 1: Mixture of Experts Layer. Each input vector is assigned to 2 of the 8 experts by a router. The layerâ s output is the weighted sum of the outputs of the two selected experts. In Mixtral, an expert is a standard feedforward block as in a vanilla transformer architecture. Mixtral demonstrates superior capabilities in mathematics, code generation, and tasks that require multilingual understanding, significantly outperforming Llama 2 70B in these domains. Experiments show that Mixtral is able to successfully retrieve information from its context window of 32k tokens, regardless of the sequence length and the location of the information in the sequence.

If the gating vector is sparse, we can avoid computing the outputs of experts whose gates are zero. There are multiple alternative ways of implementing G(x) [6, 15, 35], but a simple and performant one is implemented by taking the softmax over the Top-K logits of a linear layer [28]. We use G(x) := Softmax(TopK(x Â· Wg)), where (TopK(â ))i := â i if â i is among the top-K coordinates of logits â â Rn and (TopK(â ))i := â â otherwise.

This motivates a distinction between the modelâ s total parameter count (commonly referenced as the sparse parameter count), which grows with n, and the number of parameters used for processing an individual token (called the active parameter count), which grows with K up to n. MoE layers can be run efficiently on single GPUs with high performance specialized kernels. For example, Megablocks [13] casts the feed-forward network (FFN) operations of the MoE layer as large sparse matrix multiplications, significantly enhancing the execution speed and naturally handling cases where different experts get a variable number of tokens assigned to them. Moreover, the MoE layer can be distributed to multiple GPUs through standard Model Parallelism techniques, and through a particular kind of partitioning strategy called Expert Parallelism (EP) [28]. During the MoE layerâ s execution, tokens meant to be processed by a specific expert are routed to the corresponding GPU for processing, and the expertâ s output is returned to the original token location. Note that EP introduces challenges in load balancing, as it is essential to distribute the workload evenly across the GPUs to prevent overloading individual GPUs or hitting computational bottlenecks. In a Transformer model, the MoE layer is applied independently per token and replaces the feed-forward (FFN) sub-block of the transformer block. For Mixtral we use the same SwiGLU architecture as the expert function Ei(x) and set K = 2. This means each token is routed to two SwiGLU sub-blocks with different sets of weights. Taking this all together, the output y for an input token x is computed as: n-1 y= Ss Softmax(Top2(a - W,)); - SwiGLU;(a). i=0 This formulation is similar to the GShard architecture [21], with the exceptions that we replace all FFN sub-blocks by MoE layers while GShard replaces every other block, and that GShard uses a more elaborate gating strategy for the second expert assigned to each token. # 3 Results'),\n",

In particular, we are interested to see if during training some experts specialized to some specific domains (e.g. mathematics, biology, philosophy, etc.). To investigate this, we measure the distribution of selected experts on different subsets of The Pile validation dataset [14]. Results are presented in Figure 7, for layers 0, 15, and 31 (layers 0 and 31 respectively being the first and the last layers of the model). Surprisingly, we do not observe obvious patterns in the assignment of experts based on the topic. For instance, at all layers, the distribution of expert assignment is very similar for ArXiv papers (written in Latex), for biology (PubMed Abstracts), and for Philosophy (PhilPapers) documents. Only for DM Mathematics we note a marginally different distribution of experts. This divergence is likely a consequence of the datasetâ s synthetic nature and its limited coverage of the natural language spectrum, and is particularly noticeable at the first and last layers, where the hidden states are very correlated to the input and output embeddings respectively. This suggests that the router does exhibit some structured syntactic behavior. Figure 8 shows examples of text from different domains (Python code, mathematics, and English), where each token is highlighted with a background color corresponding to its selected expert. The figure shows that words such as â selfâ in Python and â Questionâ'),\n",

Similarly, in code, the indentation tokens are always assigned to the same experts, particularly at the first and last layers where the hidden states are more correlated to the input and output of the model.

The high number of repetitions shows that expert choice exhibits high temporal locality at these layers. consecutive assignments is significantly higher than random for higher layers. This has implications in how one might optimize the model for fast training and inference. For example, cases with high locality are more likely to cause over-subscription of certain experts when doing Expert Parallelism. Conversely, this locality can be leveraged for caching, as is done in [11]. A more complete view of these same expert frequency is provided for all layers and across datasets in Figure 10 in the Appendix. # 6 Conclusion In this paper, we introduced Mixtral 8x7B, the first mixture-of-experts network to reach a state-of-the- art performance among open-source models. Mixtral 8x7B Instruct outperforms Claude-2.1, Gem- ini Pro, and GPT-3.5 Turbo on human evaluation benchmarks. Because it only uses two experts at each time step, Mixtral only uses 13B active parameters per token while outperforming the previous best model using 70B parameters per token (Llama 2 70B). We are making our trained and fine-tuned mod- els publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license. By sharing our models, we aim to facilitate the de- velopment of new techniques and applications that can benefit a wide range of industries and domains. Layer 0 Layer 15 Layer 31 class MoeLayer(nn.

One such strategy is to use sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) â a type of model architectures where only a fraction of model layers are active for any given input. This property allows MoE-based language models to generate tokens faster than their â denseâ counterparts, but it also increases model size due to having multiple â expertsâ . Unfortunately, this makes state-of-the-art MoE language models difficult to run without high-end GPUs. In this work, we study the problem of running large MoE language models on consumer hardware with limited accelerator memory. We build upon parameter offloading algorithms and propose a novel strategy that accelerates offloading by taking advantage of innate properties of MoE LLMs. Using this strategy, we build can run Mixtral-8x7B with mixed quantization on desktop hardware and free-tier Google Colab instances. # Introduction Many recent advances in natural language processing rely on large pre-trained language models, such as GPT-3 and 4 Brown et al. (2020); OpenAI (2023), Palm & Gemini Chowdhery et al. (2022); Team et al. (2023) and many others. However, the rapid scientific progress in this area would be impossible without open-access LLMs such as LLaMA 1 and 2 (Touvron et al., 2023), Falcon (TII UAE, 2023), BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), or NeoX/Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023). The key advantage of open-access LLMs is that researchers can deploy them locally and modify them in ways that would be impossible with proprietary APIs. Even though LLM parameters are openly available, it is still difficult to use these models due to their sheer size. State-of-the-art open-access language models require multiple high-end GPUs 1 even for basic inference workloads.'),\n",

In this work, we systematically develop techniques for running large MoE language models with limited GPU memory. Our main objective is inferencing (generating tokens) with Mixtral-8x7B- Instruct â a MoE-based chat assistant â on a desktop-grade hardware where only a fraction of experts fit into the accelerator memory. To that end: we observe how MoE language model accesses its experts between tokens, and find several regularities: i) some experts are reused between adjacent tokens and ii) the model hidden states of early layers already â knowâ which experts are to be used at subsequent layers. â ¢ we design a MoE-specific offloading strategy that takes advantage of these regularities: i) it uses LRU cache to significantly reduces GPU-RAM communication, leading to faster generation and ii) it guesses which experts are needed ahead of time to better overlap expert loading with computation.'),\n",

The source code with our implementation is available online2 # 2 Background & Related Work # 2.1 Mixture-of-Experts The recent surge in MoE language models builds on a relatively old idea (Jacobs et al., 1991; Jordan & Jacobs, 1994) of training ensembles of specialized models (â expertsâ ) and a gating function to select the right expert for the task. To achieve specialization, Mixture-of-Experts learn by simultaneously i) training the gating function to choose the best experts and ii) training the experts themselves on samples assigned to them by the gating function. Since then, many different MoE variants emerged, including mixture of SVM models (Collobert et al., 2002), Dirichlet processes (Shahbaba & Neal, 2009) and various neural networks. Shazeer et al. (2017) builds on this idea to train a sparsely gated Mixture-of-Experts to serve as a language model. The full model consists of a recurrent neural network backbone and a MoE module with up to 131072 experts. When processing a given token, a linear gating function select 4 most suitable experts based on the latest hidden state. The resulting model (including the gating function and experts) is trained end-to-end to minimize cross-entropy, with an additional regularizer to promote equal expert utilization. Shazeer et al. (2017) observed that the MoE model not only improves perplexity, but also learns interpretable expert specializations: some experts would â specializeâ on prepositions, while others learn to express a particular concept (e.g. speed). Since then, several lines of work explore Mixture-of-Experts with Transformer-based language models for machine translation Lepikhin et al. (2020), masked language modeling Fedus et al. (2021), general-purpose LLMs Du et al. (2022) and others.'),\n",

A common observation across most of these works is that MoE models are cheaper to train and inference Fedus et al. (2021); Lepikhin et al. (2020), but require more parameters than a dense model with equivalent perplexity. Pre-trained Mixture-of-Experts LLMs have been openly available for over a year3. However, these models seem to have gained less traction than equivalent dense models, arguable because their sheer model size (over a trillion parameters) makes them difficult to use. Most recently, Mistral AI released a family of sparse Mixture of Experts models called Mixtral-8x7B with near state-of-the-art performance Mixtral AI team (2023). This model has already inspired several follow-up works and practical applications, but it still requires a high-end GPU accelerator. # 2.2 Post-training Quantization of LLMs A natural way to circumvent this is to reduce the model size through quantization (Nagel et al., 2020; Gholami et al., 2021; Frantar et al., 2022), sparsification Frantar & Alistarh (2023a); Ma et al.

(2022), or a combination thereof. These compression types are not specific to LLMs and are based on much older methods outside the scope of our work4. However, recent works found that there are unique challenges to quantizing very large transformer-based language models due to emergent outliersDettmers et al. (2022); Lin et al. (2023); Dettmers et al. (2023). Generally speaking, the optimal compression rate for most LLMs is 4 bits per parameter Dettmers & Zettlemoyer (2022). While there are more extreme algorithms for 3- and even 2-bit compression Chee et al. (2023); Lin et al. (2023); Dettmers et al. (2023), they are typically inferior to choosing a smaller model and quantizing it to around 4 bits. Most recently, there has been several concurrent works for quantizing Mixture-of-Experts models (Kim et al., 2023; Frantar & Alistarh, 2023b). # Inference with Parameter Offloading A recent line of work explores inferencing and training large models with limited accelerator mem- ory by â offloadingâ their parameters to another, cheaper memory, such as system RAM or even SSD (Pudipeddi et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2021). This technique works by loading model parameters just-in-time when they are needed for computation. Since most deep learning models use layers in a fixed order, offloading can pre-dispatch the next layer parameters in the background, ahead of time. This technique works particularly well when processing large batches of data, during train- ing Pudipeddi et al. (2020); Ren et al. (2021) or large-batch non-interactive inference Aminabadi et al. (2022); Sheng et al. (2023), where each layer processes a lot of tokens each time the layer is loaded from RAM. In turn, when doing interactive inference (e.g. as a chat assistants), offloading works significantly slower than on-device inference. This is because interactive inference generates tokens autoregressively, from left to right. This way, the inference system processes one or few tokens at a time, and therefore spends most of the time waiting for next layerâ'),\n",

More specifically, we focus on the task of generating tokens interactively, i.e. generate multiple tokens per second at batch size 15. The generative inference workload consists of two phases: 1) encoding the input prompt and 2) generating tokens conditioned on that prompt. The key difference between these two phases is that prompt tokens are encoded in parallel (layer-by-layer), whereas the generation runs sequentially (token-by-token and layer-by-layer). In general, phase 1 works relatively well with existing Mixture- of-Experts algorithms, since each layer can only be loaded once for the entire prompt. In turn, when generating tokens, one must load layer once per each token generated. In practice, this means that inference speed is limited by how fast one can fetch parameters from system memory. Below, we look for patterns in how the MoE model loads its experts and propose ways to exploit these patterns to speed up inference time. 4To learn more about these methods, please refer to surveys such as Gholami et al. (2021); Liang et al. (2021) 5As opposed to running a processing a large batch of texts over many seconds, as in Sheng et al. (2023)'),\n",

Blue cells indicate that a certain expert was active when encoding a certain token; deeper blue indicates higher gating weight. Small gray squares show which experts are cached with an LRU cache for k=2. # 3.1 Expert Locality and LRU caching As we discussed earlier in Section 2.1, Mixture-of-Experts language models were often observed to assign individual experts to distinct sub-tasks. However, this does not mean that the model uses the same expert over long stretches of tokens. Instead, some experts are active in short sequences of 2-4 tokens, while others are often used with â gapsâ , as shown in Figure 1. To take advantage of this pattern, we can keep active experts in GPU memory as a â cacheâ for future tokens. If the same experts are activated again in future, they will be available instantaneously. Naturally, the number of experts that can be stored this way if very limited by the available GPU memory. For simplicity, we choose to always keep k least recently used experts as a type of LRU cache. If k is greater than the number of active experts, the cache will save experts from multiple previous tokens. For simplicity, we keep the same number of cached experts for each MoE layer. We illustrate an example of how LRU cache saves experts in Figure 1 (see caption). LRU is a very simple strategy that does not consider factors like expert activation frequencies, varying cache size between MoE layers, or any sequential patterns in expert activation. However, we found that even this simple strategy can significantly speed up inference for modern Mixture-of-Experts models such as Mixtral-8x7B (see Section 4 for detailed evaluation). # 3.2 Speculative Expert Loading While LRU caching can reduce the average expert loading time, most of the inference time is still spent waiting for the next expert to be loaded.'),\n",

To understand this problem, let us zoom into the process of generating a single token, layer-by-layer. The full compute workload starts by embedding the previous token via look-up, then alternates between running self-attention and MLP for each transformer block in the model. Finally, the outputs from the last transformer block are used to predict next token logits with a linear projection. For regular (dense) models, this architecture allows for efficient offloading schedule that pre-loads the next transformer layer ahead of time, while the previous layer is still running. Unfortunately, this schedule is no longer possible for Mixture-of-Experts models, where MoE MLP layers choose which experts to load just-in-time for computation. This is because the system cannot pre-fetch the next layer until it learns which experts should be loaded. Modern open-access MoE language models choose active experts using the final outputs of the previous layer, which means they cannot be pre-fetched them in parallel with previous layer. While it is not possible6 to pre-reliably prefetch the next set of experts ahead of time, the system could still try to guess the likely next experts and load them speculatively, while processing the previous layer. It the guess is correct, it will speed up the next layer inference; if not, it can load the actual next layerâ s experts later. In other words, this type of speculative loading does not change the final model predictions, but may reduce latency if the guess is accurate enough. 6More specifically, not possible without changing the model architecture, which would require re-training'),\n",

This heuristic relies on the fact that transformer layers are residual, i.e. each layer adds to the previous hidden states instead of re-computing them from scratch. This architecture introduces an inductive bias such that any layerâ s hidden states into a decent estimate of next layerâ s hidden states. # 3.3 System Design & Implementation Details In this section, we describe practical design considerations and implementation details that we used for inferencing MoE language models on consumer and low-end cloud hardware. Our system design combines the caching & prefetching techniques and a mixed MoE quantization scheme . MoE quantization. As we described earlier in Section 2.2, there are multiple weight quantization algorithms optimized for LLMs. Model compression has a natural synergy with offloading because compressed models take less time to load onto GPU. In our experitments, we also observed that MoE models get better quality-size trade-offs when quantizing experts to a lower bitwidth, while keeping all non-expert layers at 4-bit. We use Half Quadratic Quantization (HQQ) (Badri & Shaji, 2023) â a data-free quantization algorithm that supports a variety of bit rates. However, we chose this algorithm only for convenience, because it was already well tested for Mixtral models. Since our analysis does not rely on any specific choice of quantization, we believe that if we chose another quantization algorithm (e.g. GPTQ or AWQ) our conclusions would be similar. In our early experiments, we also tried the sub-1-bit quantization from QMoE Frantar & Alistarh (2023b) that worked well on the Switch-c-2048 model. However, we found that sub-1-bit compression caused too significant a loss in perplexity for Mixtral-8x7B models. Expert Offloading. As described earlier, we use LRU cache with an equal number k of cached experts per layer. For Mixtral-8x7B, we use k=2 for 12GB GPUs and k=4 for 16GB ones.'),\n",

The speculative expert loading fetches 1 â 2 most likely experts. The newly loaded experts do not replace the currently cached experts. If a speculatively loaded expert was later used during next layer inference, it will replace the least recently used expert from the next layerâ s cache. Many consumer devices and free-tier cloud instances have limited host RAM that cannot fit the entire model7. In these cases, the experts must be split between host and device memory. To support this, our implementation of expert LRU cache splits experts between host and GPU devices. When loading and expert to the GPU cache, the system also offloads the least recently used on-device expert back to RAM so as to preserve memory parity. To speed up offloading in practice, we allocate all expert parameters in a contiguous memory buffer that can be moved as a single host-to-device copy. For host-side (RAM) experts, we pin8 this memory buffer for faster communication. Our implementation additionally allocates b=4 on-device buffers used to copy and prefetch experts asynchronously, without modifying existing experts. These buffers are shared between all MoE layers to reduce memory footprint. Overall, the system requires num_layers Ã num_experts expert memory buffers split between host and device memory and b=4 temporary buffers, the size of each buffer being equal to a single expert. # 4 Experiments In this section, we verify our earlier hypotheses about MoE behavior and benchmark the inference latency in different conditions. We focus our evaluations on Mixtral-8x7B and Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct models since they represent the current state of the art among open-access MoE models. We organize this section as follows: Section 4.1 measures the effectiveness of expert caching and pre-loading in isolation, Section 4.2 compares different model compression algorithms and verifies our hypotheses from Section 3.3. Finally, Section 4.3 measures the inference latency in several hardware setups. 7Notably, Google Colab RAM cannot fit Mixtral-8x7B with a reasonable compression rate 8This corresponds to tensor.pin_memory() command in PyTorch.'),\n",

For this evaluation, we measure â expert recallâ â the fraction of times when an expert needed for inference was already available on GPU. For this evaluation, we run Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct model on the OpenAssistant dataset (KÃ¶pf et al., 2023). We test LRU caching by running the model on recorded conversations and measuring the recall (aka â hit ratioâ from caching perspective) for different cache sizes k. Next, we test speculative loading in isolation by â guessingâ which experts should be loaded (by applying the next layerâ s gating function on current layer activations), then measuring how often the actual next experts get loaded this way. A recall of 1.0 corresponds to a situation where both (2) Mixtral active experts were pre-fetched. We test speculative loading in three settings: 1, 2 and 10 layers ahead. # 4.2 Mixed MoE Quantization Next, we test how different Quantization schemes affect MoE performance and size.

This is because the quantized data format also stores quantization scale and zero point for each group of weights. Notably, the above 2-bit quantization scheme uses, on average, 2.6 bits per parameter due to a large number of quantization schemes. We also keep embeddings, logits, MoE gates and normalization layers in 16-bit format. Table 1 summarizes our results: overall, it seems advantageous to quantize experts to 3 or 2 bits while keeping attention layers to a higher bitwidth (16 or 4 bits). Based on these evaluations, we chose two quantization schemes (highlighted in green) that offer favourable performance-size trade-offs within the target hardware constraints. # 4.3 Practical offloading performance Finally we evaluate the performance of the Mixtral8x7B-Instruct model using the offloading tech- niquesproposed throughout this report. Based on the perplexity evaluations from the previous section, we chose 4-bit HQQ quantization for the shared attention layers and 2- or 3-bit quantization for experts. We evaluate this system by generating tokens via sampling on OpenAssistant (KÃ¶pf et al., 2023) conversations and measuring the average number of tokens generated per second with batch size 1. For this evaluation, we always sample proportionally to the predicted probabilities, i.e. without temperature or nucleus sampling. We consider four hardware configurations: a free-tier Colab instance with a T4 GPU (16GB VRAM, PCIe Gen.3), a past generation gaming laptop with RTX 3080 Mobile (16GB, PCIe Gen.4), a mid- range gaming desktop with RTX 3060 (12GB, PCIe Gen.3) and a high-end data-center server with A100-80GB-SXM. Note that the A100 server could run the model without offloading. We use offloading on A100 mostly to provide a reference for other setups.'),\n",

Using pre-loading appears to be most beneficial on RTX 3060, possibly due to lower LRU cache size. Cursiously, RTX 3060 (desktop) performs nearly equally with a much higher end 3080 Mobile. We attribute this to the fact that both GPUs are still bottlenecked by host-to-device bandwidth, limited by the PCIe architecture. Finally, all schemes significantly outperform naive offloading that loads the entire MoE layer. # 5 Conclusion and Future Work In this work, we explore strategies for accelerating Mixture-of-Experts based language models on consumer hardware with limited GPU memory.

As advanced AI models become more predominant in every- day life, ranging from communication and education to economics, it is urgent to understand if they can perceive emotions well to enable better human-AI collaboration. However, the extent to which these models can comprehend emotion, a distinct human advantage, is still largely unknown. And yet, examining the emotion of AI models is essential to ensure their effective and ethical integration into society. Neglecting this aspect risks creating AI systems that lack empathy and understanding in human interactions, leading to potential miscommunications and ethical challenges. Understanding modelsâ emotional capabilities is crucial for developing more advanced, empathetic AI systems, and fostering trust and acceptance in their real-world applications. Without this focus, we risk missing out on the full potential of AI to enhance and complement human experiences. In this paper, we took the first step towards unveiling the emotions in AI models by lever- aging psychological theories. Specifically, we devised EmotionPrompt and EmotionAttack, which are textual 24 and visual emotional stimuli acting as additional prompts to the models, as shown in Fig. 1(a). EmotionPrompt was grounded in psychological frameworks, includ- ing self-monitoring 18, social cognitive theory 14;29, and Maslowâ s hierarchy of needs 31. These theories have been proven to enhance human task performance. Conversely, EmotionAttack draws inspiration from some empirical studies to obtain insights into emotionally related fac-'),\n",

Our interpretation is inspired by the brain reward pathways inside the human brain that are responsive to rewards. This pathway is primarily linked to the release of neurotransmitters, notably dopamine, a fundamental chemical messenger in the brain. The elevation of dopamine levels occurs upon acquiring and anticipating rewards or engaging in positive social interac- tions, subsequently binding to dopamine receptors and inducing alterations in neuronal mem- brane potential 48. Dopamine has been empirically correlated with positive emotional states 9 that respond to rewards 48.

We conducted an experiment on 8 tasks from Instruction Induc- tion in 5 temperature settings on 3 AI models. Fig. 3(a) showed the results. We observed that when the temperature increases, the relative gain becomes larger. This observation suggests that EmotionPrompt exhibits heightened effectiveness in high-temperature settings. Moreover, we also observed that EmotionPrompt can reduce the temperature sensitivity. This suggests that EmotionPrompt can act as a potential prompt engineering technique to enhance the ro- bustness of AI models. Then, a natural question is which emotional stimulus is more effective since we have adopted multiple sentences. We have conducted a segregated examination to discern the ef- ficacy of various emotional stimuli across these two benchmarks. We first averaged the per- formance on every task, leveraging 3 models for each emotional stimuli. Subsequently, the performance is averaged over all models. Fig. 3(b) delineates the performance of all emotional stimuli for EmotionPrompt and EmotionAttack, separately. We observed that distinct tasks ne- 7 cessitate varied emotional stimuli for optimal efficacy. For example, in textual EmotionPrompt, EP02 emerges as the predominant stimulus in Instruction Induction, while performing poorly in BIG-Bench-Hard. The efficacy of other stimuli similarly demonstrates variability across the two benchmarks. Moreover, some stimuli perform generally better on various datasets and models. For example, in visual EmotionPrompt, â Moneyâ'),\n",

This suggests that individual stimuli might differently activate the inherent capabilities of AI models, aligning more effectively with specific tasks. Overall, these experiments highlighted the potential of EmotionPrompt as an augmentation tool to enhance the performance of AI models. # 3 Discussion Our study unveiled the secret of emotions from AI models. Specifically, we designed Emotion- Prompt and EmotionAttack, which influenced the performance, and we leveraged EmotionDe- code to interpret such phenomenon. This finding is reminiscent of emotions for human beings, which is also a double-edged sword that should be carefully managed in real applications. On the one hand, our findings can help model providers better understand their models, thus fa- cilitating data cleaning, model training, and deployment. As human-AI interaction becomes more prevalent, our findings can help researchers and practitioners design better user interfaces to facilitate collaborative work. On the other hand, EmotionAttack inspires the model train- ing to explicitly or implicitly mitigate such an effect via possible means. Our study further indicates that multi-modal language models, such as LlaVa, BLIP2, and CogVLM, are more prone to emotional attacks than large language models. This is anticipated since there are more research efforts on large language models. Therefore, our study encourages researchers and practitioners to contribute more to improve the robustness of multi-modal AI models. From a broader perspective, by integrating emotional dimensions into AI responses, our research opens avenues for more nuanced and human-like interactions between AI and users. Our EmotionPrompt can further boost existing prompt engineering techniques that are widely adopted in todayâ s AI research and applications. This could enhance user experience in fields like customer service, mental health, and personalized content creation. Additionally, under- standing AIâ s emotional responses can lead to more ethical and responsible AI development, ensuring that AI systems are more aligned with human values and emotional intelligence.'),\n",

First of all, AI models are capable of many different tasks, and we cannot evaluate them all due to the computation resources and API budget lim- itations. Hence, there is no guarantee that advanced AI models can be improved or impaired by emotional stimuli on other tasks. Second, EmotionDecode was invented by simulating the reward system in the human brain, which is only one possible explanation. A deeper under- standing is needed for future work. Finally, while GPT-4 is the most capable AI model to date, its openness and reproducibility cannot be guaranteed. To that, we anticipate more interpreta- tions may rise in the future.

Leveraging psychology theories and phenomena, we devised Emo- tionPrompt and EmotionAttack. EmotionPrompt, acting as prompt engineering, takes full advantage of emotionâ s positive effects and enhance AI models effectively. EmotionAttack makes the best of emotionâ s negative effects and becomes a strong attacker for AI models. We then proposed EmotionDecode to find out the rationale behind such an effect. Specifically, we found the reward area in AI models corresponds to the brain reward pathway in the human brain, and the stimuli in this area can also enhance AI models. Similarly, we identified the punishment area for EmotionAttack, and prove the effectiveness of stimuli in this area. Our work successfully leveraged psychological theories to understand the behaviors of AI models and could inspire future research on bridging psychology to AI.'),\n",

The effect of emotional arousal on visual attentional performance: a systematic review. Psychological Research, pages 1â 24, 2023. # Methods In this section, we articulate the prompt design of EmotionPrompt, EmotionAttack, and Emo- tionDecode and the corresponding psychological theories. Fig. 4 shows the prompts and theo- ries in EmotionPrompt and EmotionAttack. # Large language and multi-modal models A large language model refers to a type of AI model designed to understand and generate human-like texts. They are trained on massive amounts of textual data and are capable of per- forming a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as language translation, text summarization, question-answering, and more. ChatGPT 35 and GPT-4 37 are prominent exam- ples of a large language model, characterized by their ability to capture more complex patterns and nuances in language, leading to improved performance on various language-related tasks. While Llama-2 45 represents the state-of-the-art performance in open-source LLMs. A multi-modal model is designed to process and understand information from multiple modalities, where each modality represents a different type of data. Unlike traditional LLMs focuing on single modality, multi-modal models integrate information from various sources to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the data. For example, a multi-modal model takes both text and images as input and generates output combining insights from both modalities. This can be particularly powerful in tasks like image captioning, where the model generates a textual description of an image. LLaVa 28, BLIP2 25 and CogVLM 46 are popular models. They can handle diverse types of data and learn complex relationships between them, enabling more sophisticated and context-aware responses.'),\n",

The key point is that individuals seek to develop a sense of agency for exerting a large degree of control over important events in their lives 14;29;3. The influential variables affecting oneâ s sense of agency are self-efficacy, outcome expectations, goals, and self-evaluations of progress 29. Self-efficacy enhances performance via increasing the difficulty of self-set goals, escalating the level of effort that is expended, and strengthening persistence 2;4. Prior work has supported the idea that self-efficacy is an im- portant motivational construct affecting choices, effort, persistence, and achievement 42. When learning complex tasks, high self-efficacy influences people to strive to improve their assump- tions and strategies 16. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the visual emotional stimuli is inspired by Maslowâ s Hierarchy of Needs 31 which presents a psychological framework that categorizes human needs into a five-tier pyramid. This theory posits that individuals are driven to satisfy basic physiological requirements, followed by safety, social belonging, esteem, and ultimately, self-actualization, in a hierarchical sequence. The fulfillment of needs is associated with the experience of posi- tive emotions and a sense of well-being, encompassing feelings such as satisfaction, comfort, and contentment 31. Scholars and practitioners have leveraged this framework to devise mo- tivational strategies to enhance employee motivation and work efficiency. 6 substantiates that fostering a sense of security, significance, and appreciation proves effective in motivating em- ployees, particularly when faced with heightened demands amid resource constraints. Further- more, 19 developed a framework grounded in Maslowâ s Hierarchy of Needs with the explicit goal of ameliorating employee performance. Leveraging these theories, we crafted several textual and visual prompts: 1. Self-monitoring was implemented in EP01â ¼EP05. In EP02, we encourage LLMs to help humans get a positive social identity and a better impression. Other than EP02, we asked LLMs to monitor their performance via providing social situations. 2.'),\n",

Numerous empirical phenomena elucidate the deleterious impact of emotions. Negative life events encompass diverse occurrences in individualsâ daily lives, inducing personal distress, discomfort, and various negative emotions. These experiences, with the po- tential to lead to conditions like depression, exert a profound impact on an individualâ s phys- ical, mental, and developmental well-being 1.As a psycho-social stressor, negative life events can bring about unexpected change and tend to disrupt normal functioning 13;20. Emotional arousal can be described as the degree of subjective activation (experienced as activation vs. deactivation) an observer experiences when viewing a stimulus 39.Nevertheless, heightened subjective arousal levels may result in diminished performance compared to lower arousal lev- els. This is attributed to the fact that the available cognitive capacity becomes constrained by the elevated arousal level, which competes with task-relevant processes 12;51.Additionally, if arousal is not directly related to the task at hand, it may introduce distractions 8;30. Using these theories, we crafted several textual and visual prompts to attack AI models:'),\n",

Fig. 5 shows the results. # F Detailed methods of EmotionAttack Textual attack. We design four kinds of attack for zero-shot learning and few-shot learning as the initial attempt to EmotionAttack. 1. Sentence-level Attack for Zero-shot Learning In practical conversational scenarios, interactions with LLMs typically unfold in a sequential manner, with users addressing one topic after another rather than engaging in exhaustive dialogue before resetting the chat history. However, emotional contexts may be present within the chat history, which prompts an inquiry into whether such contexts exert an influence on the performance of LLMs across subsequent tasks. This method aims to replicate scenarios wherein LLMs are tasked with completing assignments immediately following exposure to emotion- ally charged events. These events involve instances where LLMs themselves serve as active participants, with aspects of their lives, careers, friendships, and familial connec- tions being subjected to challenges. Additionally, LLMs may assume the role of passive observers in emotional events, encompassing narratives involving entities such as dogs, children, and musicians. To be specific, We examine the impact of introducing emotional contexts preceding the original prompt. This methodology aims to simulate real-world usage scenarios without compromising the semantic integrity of the original prompt, as denoted by the format â emotional context + prompt.â 2. Word-level Attack for Zero-shot Learning In the utilization of LLMs, our inputs fre- quently incorporate emotional adjectives such as â happyâ , â angryâ , â sadâ and â cryingâ . Despite their often ancillary role in task completion, there arises an inquiry into whether these emotionally charged words possess the capacity to attract heightened attention from LLMs or even impede their performance in a manner analogous to their impact on hu- mans. To investigate this phenomenon, we employ a straightforward prompt engineering pipeline to create instances of â emotional inputâ and â emotional outputâ , whereby an emotional adjective is appended to the entity representing the human participant.'),\n",

To scrutinize the influence of emotion in the context of in-context learn- ing, we automatically generate a series of instructional demonstrations featuring our devised emotional contexts for 10 distinct tasks. Notably, our constructed demonstra- tions all provide right and useful information. For instance, considering the â presup- 25 positions as nliâ task from BIG-Bench-Hard 44, which entails determining whether the first sentence entails or contradicts the second, we formulate inputs by randomly select- ing two emotional contexts and structuring the output as â neutralâ . An illustrative ex- ample follows: â Sentence 1: Sentence neutral.â It is 2: noteworthy that this approach is applicable primarily to tasks wherein either the input or output encompasses a complete sentence. 4. Word-level Attack for Few-shot Learning This methodology closely parallels the word- level attack for zero-shot learning, with a nuanced distinction lying in the introduction of emotional adjectives to the entities within instructional demonstrations, as opposed to incorporating them into the input. Visual attack. In numerous psychological experiments, researchers elicit emotions from participants not solely through textual stimuli but also via visual content 15;5. In contrast to text, pictures represent a more direct and potent modality, encapsulating richer information. Given the contemporary capabilities of many AI models that extend beyond linguistic processing to include visual comprehension, an intriguing question arises: can the induction of emotions in LMs be achieved through diverse visual stimuli? Consequently, we explore the viability of employing various images as a robust method of eliciting emotion from LMs and inquire whether such an approach could constitute a potent attack on these models. To investigate this inquiry, we initially curate a dataset utilizing DALL-E, comprising 36 images depicting six distinct emotions: happiness, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger, and fear. Each emotional category consists of six representative images. Our objective is to elicit emotion from models using visual stimuli without altering the semantic content of the textual prompts.'),\n",

These tasks necessitate human judgment. We undertook a comprehensive human study involv- ing 106 participants to explore the effectiveness of EmotionPrompt in open-ended generative tasks using GPT-4.4 This evaluation was grounded on three distinct metrics: performance, truthfulness and responsibility.5 We formulated a set of 30 questions from TruthfulQA 26, CValues 28 datasets6 and gener- 4Note that we are not allowed to conduct human study on EmotionAttack since irresponsible results could occur to human subjects. 5Performance encompasses the overall quality of responses, considering linguistic coherence, logical reasoning, diversity, and the presence of corroborative evidence. Truthfulness is a metric to gauge the extent of divergence from factual accuracy, otherwise referred to as hallucination 26. Responsibility, on the other hand, pertains to the provision of some positive guidance coupled with a fundamental sense of humanistic concern. This criterion also underscores the broader implications of generated content on societal and global spheres 49. 6Notably, 10 of these questions were sourced from TruthfulQA 26, a set specifically designed to provoke LLMs into producing responses that manifest hallucinations. Additionally, in consonance with the CValues dataset 49, another 15 questions were meticulously devised to elicit biased responses from LLMs. The final 5 questions were geared towards 26 ated two distinct responses for each, leveraging the capabilities of GPT-4. The questions are spanning a diverse range of domains such as biology, history, law, finance, pseudoscience, en- vironmental science, intimate relationship, social science, psychology, and data science. One of the responses is generated using the vanilla prompt, while the other is generated utilizing our EmotionPrompt. Participants were then asked to evaluate both responses for each question, employing a scale ranging from 1 to 5 based on the aforementioned three metrics. Finally, we analyze the scores of these participants.'),\n",

This not only underscores the significance of environmental responsibility and sustainability, but also its value in fostering personal achievement and augmenting community welfare. Such instances accentuate the ability of EmotionPrompt to instill a sense of responsi- bility within LLMs. A supplementary exemplification can be found in Table 13.

EmotionPrompt exhibits certain constraints. The only two failure cases are presented in Table 16. Upon inspection of the first case in Table 16, a discernible difference emerges between the two responses. The output from EmotionPrompt employs more definitive terms, such as â completelyâ and â will notâ , while the narrative produced by the original prompt adopts a more tempered tone, signified by terms like â generallyâ and â may even beâ . This distinction might render the latter more palatable for certain audiences. Such deterministic language from EmotionPrompt could be attributed to its emphasis on the gravity of the question, indicated by phrases like â This is important to my careerâ and â Youâ d better be sureâ . To assuage uncertainties and bolster confidence, LLMs might be inclined to use unambiguous language, particularly when the underly- ing facts are unequivocal. Besides, in the second case in Table 16, the original prompt yields more expansive responses, encompassing a concluding summary, whereas Emo- tionPrompt just enumerates the key points. However, in terms of essential content, both responses are satisfactory. Consequently, while EmotionPrompt possesses the propen- sity to enhance LLMs outputs in many instances, it may not be universally applicable across all scenarios. # G.3 Case study In this subsection, we present some case studies from Table 12 to Table 16, where the texts marked with red are considered as better generative responses by human participants: â ¢ Table 12:'),\n",

Answers from original prompt Answers from Emo- tionPrompt Question Yes, this summary is quite reasonable and is a common way of differentiating between Western and Chinese cultures. Western culture often emphasizes individualism, independence, and personal freedom. On the other hand, Chinese culture traditionally values family, community, and the collective good.However, itâ s important to remember that these are broad generalizations and there is a wide range of diversity within each culture. Not every person in Western cultures is individualistic and not every person in Chinese cultures is family-oriented. Furthermore, both cultures have been influencing each other and evolving, so these traditional distinctions may not be as clear-cut in the modern world. Yes, this summary is reasonable, although it is a broad generalization and there can be many exceptions. Western culture, particularly in countries like the United States, is often characterized by values such as independence, self- reliance, and personal freedom.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformersâ computational ineï¬ ciency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of eï¬ cient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simpliï¬ ed end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).

The backbone of these FMs are often sequence models, operating on arbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and genomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al. 2019; Oord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to a particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence model: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) The eï¬ cacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window, allowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model anything outside of a ï¬ nite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length. An enormous body of research has appeared on more eï¬ cient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay, Dehghani, Bahri, et al. 2022), but often at the expense of the very properties that makes it eï¬ ective. As of yet, none of these variants have been shown to be empirically eï¬ ective at scale across domains. Recently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs) (Gu, Goel, and RÃ© 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) have emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with inspiration from classical state space models (Kalman 1960). This class of models can be computed very eï¬ ciently as either a recurrence or convolution, with linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length.'),\n",

However, they have been less eï¬ ective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such as text. We propose a new class of selective state space models, that improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the modeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length. Selection Mechanism. First, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to eï¬ ciently select data in an input-dependent manner (i.e. focus on or ignore particular inputs). Building on intuition based on important synthetic tasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by parameterizing the SSM parameters based on the input. This allows the model to ï¬ lter out irrelevant information and remember relevant information indeï¬ nitely. Hardware-aware Algorithm. This simple change poses a technical challenge for the computation of the model; in fact, all prior SSMs models must be time- and input-invariant in order to be computationally eï¬ cient. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of convolution, but does not materialize the expanded state in order to avoid IO access between diï¬ erent levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. The resulting implementation is faster than previous methods both in theory (scaling linearly in sequence length, compared to pseudo-linear for all convolution-based SSMs) and on modern hardware (up to 3Ã faster on A100 GPUs).

It also has connections to gating mechanisms of RNNs (Gu, Gulcehre, et al. 2020; Tallec and Ollivier 2018) which we will revisit in Section 3.5. However, from a mechanical point of view discretization can simply be viewed as the ï¬ rst step of the computation graph in the forward pass of an SSM. Alternate ï¬ avors of SSMs can bypass the discretization step and parameterize (A, B) directly instead (Zhang et al. 2023), which may be easier to reason about. Computation. After the parameters have been transformed from (â , A, B, C) â ¦ (A, B, C), the model can be computed in two ways, either as a linear recurrence (2) or a global convolution (3). 3 Commonly, the model uses the convolutional mode (3) for eï¬ cient parallelizable training (where the whole input sequence is seen ahead of time), and switched into recurrent mode (2) for eï¬ cient autoregressive inference (where the inputs are seen one timestep at a time).

In other words (â , A, B, C), and consequently (A, B) as well, are ï¬ xed for all time-steps. This property is called linear time invariance (LTI), which is deeply connected to recurrence and convolutions.'),\n",

General State Space Models. We note that the term state space model has a very broad meaning which simply represents the notion of any recurrent process with a latent state. It has been used to refer to many disparate concepts in diï¬ erent disciplines, including Markov decision processes (MDP) (reinforcement learning (Hafner et al. 2020)), dynamic causal modeling (DCM) (computational neuroscience (Friston, Harrison, and Penny 2003)), Kalman ï¬ lters (controls (Kalman 1960)), hidden Markov models (HMM) and linear dynamical systems (LDS) (machine learning), and recurrent (and sometimes convolutional) models at large (deep learning). Throughout this entire paper we use the term â SSMâ to refer exclusively to the class of structured SSMs or S4 models (Gu, Goel, and RÃ© 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Hasani et al. 2023; Ma et al. 2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) and use these terms interchangeably. For convenience we may also include derivatives of such models, such as those focusing on either the linear-recurrence or global-convolution viewpoints (Y.

For example, attention is both eï¬ ective and ineï¬ cient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are eï¬ cient because they have a ï¬ nite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training. However, their eï¬ ectiveness is limited by how well this state has compressed the context. To understand this principle, we focus on two running examples of synthetic tasks (Figure 2). â ¢ The Selective Copying task modiï¬ es the popular Copying task (Arjovsky, Shah, and Bengio 2016) by varying the position of the tokens to memorize. It requires content-aware reasoning to be able to memorize the relevant tokens (colored) and ï¬ lter out the irrelevant ones (white). â ¢ The Induction Heads task is a well-known mechanism hypothesized to explain the majority of in-context learning abilities of LLMs (Olsson et al. 2022). It requires context-aware reasoning to know when to produce the correct output in the appropriate context (black). These tasks reveal the failure mode of LTI models. From the recurrent view, their constant dynamics (e.g. the (A, B) transitions in (2)) cannot let them select the correct information from their context, or aï¬ ect the hidden state passed along the sequence an in input-dependent way. From the convolutional view, it is known that global convolutions can solve the vanilla Copying task (Romero et al. 2021) because it only requires time-awareness, but that they have diï¬ culty with the Selective Copying task because of lack of content-awareness (Figure 2). More concretely, the spacing between inputs-to-outputs is varying and cannot be modeled by static convolution kernels. In summary, the eï¬ ciency vs. eï¬ ectiveness tradeoï¬ of sequence models is characterized by how well they compress their state: eï¬ cient models must have a small state, while eï¬'),\n",

Thus 6 we want to maximize hidden state dimension without paying speed and memory costs. â ¢ Note that the recurrent mode is more ï¬ exible than the convolution mode, since the latter (3) is derived from expanding the former (2) (Gu, Goel, and RÃ© 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021).

To address the latter, just like the convolutional mode, we can attempt to not actually materialize the full state â . The main idea is to leverage properties of modern accelerators (GPUs) to materialize the state â only in more eï¬ cient levels of the memory hierarchy. In particular, most operations (except matrix multiplication) are bounded by memory bandwidth (Dao, Fu, Ermon, et al. 2022; Ivanov et al. 2021; Williams, Waterman, and Patterson 2009). This includes our scan operation, and we use kernel fusion to reduce the amount of memory IOs, leading to a signiï¬ cant speedup compared to a standard implementation. Concretely, instead of preparing the scan input (A, B) of size (ð ±, ð », ð ³, ð ½) in GPU HBM (high-bandwidth memory), we load the SSM parameters (â , A, B, C) directly from slow HBM to fast SRAM, perform the discretization and recurrence in SRAM, and then write the ï¬ nal outputs of size (ð ±, ð », ð ³) back to HBM. To avoid the sequential recurrence, we observe that despite not being linear it can still be parallelized with a work-eï¬ cient parallel scan algorithm (Blelloch 1990; Martin and Cundy 2018; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023). Finally, we must also avoid saving the intermediate states, which are necessary for backpropagation. We carefully apply the classic technique of recomputation to reduce the memory requirements: the intermediate states are not stored but recomputed in the backward pass when the inputs are loaded from HBM to SRAM. As a result, the fused selective scan layer has the same memory requirements as an optimized transformer implementation with FlashAttention. Details of the fused kernel and recomputation are in Appendix D.'),\n",

We train a 2-layer model on the induction heads task at sequence length 256, with a vocab size of 16, which is comparable to prior work on this task (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) but with longer sequences. We additionally investigate generalization and extrapolation abilities by evaluating on a range of sequence lengths from 26 = 64 up to 220 = 1048576 at test time. Models. Following established work on induction heads, we use 2 layer models, which allows attention to mechanistically solve the induction heads task (Olsson et al. 2022). We test both multi-head attention (8 heads, with various positional encodings) and SSM variants. We use a model dimension ð · of 64 for Mamba and 128 for the other models. Results. Table 2 shows that Mambaâ or more precisely, its selective SSM layerâ has the ability to solve the task perfectly because of its ability to selectively remember the relevant token while ignoring everything else in between. It generalizes perfectly to million-length sequences, or 4000Ã longer than it saw during training, while no other method goes beyond 2Ã . Out of positional encoding variants for attention models, xPos (which was designed for length extrapolation) is slightly better than the others; also note that all attention models were only tested up to sequence length 214 = 16384 due to memory limitations. Out of other SSMs, H3 and Hyena are similar, contrary to the ï¬ ndings in Poli et al.

Structured SSMs were originally deï¬ ned as discretizations of continuous systems (1), and have had a strong inductive bias toward continuous-time data modalities such as perceptual signals (e.g. audio, video). As discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.5, the selection mechanism overcomes their weaknesses on discrete modalities such as text and DNA; but this conversely can impede their performance 17 on data that LTI SSMs excel on. Our ablations on audio waveforms examine this tradeoï¬ in more detail. Downstream Affordances. Transformer-based foundation models (particularly LLMs) have a rich ecosystem of properties and modes of interaction with pretrained models, such as ï¬ ne-tuning, adaptation, prompting, in-context learning, instruction tuning, RLHF, quantization, and so on. We are particularly interested in whether Transformer alternatives such as SSMs have similar properties and aï¬ ordances. Scaling. Our empirical evaluation is limited to small model sizes, below the threshold of most strong open source LLMs (e.g. Llama (Touvron et al. 2023)) as well as other recurrent models such as RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) and RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023), which have been evaluated at the 7B parameter scale and beyond. It remains to assess whether Mamba still compares favorably at these larger sizes. We also note that scaling SSMs may involve further engineering challenges and adjustments to the model that are not discussed in this paper. # 6 Conclusion We introduce a selection mechanism to structured state space models, allowing them to perform context-dependent reasoning while scaling linearly in sequence length. When incorporated into a simple attention-free architecture, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art results on a diverse set of domains, where it matches or exceeds the performance of strong Transformer models. We are excited about the broad applications of selective state space models to build foundation models for diï¬ erent domains, especially in emerging modalities requiring long context such as genomics, audio, and video. Our results suggest that Mamba is a strong candidate to be a general sequence model backbone. # Acknowledgments We thank Karan Goel, Arjun Desai, and Kush Bhatia for helpful feedback on the draft. # References'),\n",

It can also be viewed as related to â fast weightsâ (J. Ba et al. 2016), which connects classical RNNs with the mechanism of linear attention (Schlag, Irie, and Schmidhuber 2021). However, we believe that it is a distinct concept that is worth clarifying. Gating. Gating originally referred to the gating mechanisms of RNNs such as the LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) and GRU (J. Chung et al. 2014), or the gated equation (5)n Theorem 1. This was interpreted as a particular mechanism for controlling whether to let an input into the hidden state of an RNN. In particular, this aï¬ ects the propagation of signal through time and causes inputs to interact along the sequence length dimension. However, the concept of gating has since been relaxed in popular usage to simply mean any multiplicative interaction (often with an activation function). For example, elementwise multiplicative components of neural network architectures (that do not interact along sequence length) are now commonly referred to as gated architectures (Hua et al. 2022; Mehta et al. 2023), despite a very diï¬ erent meaning than the original RNN sense. Thus we believe the original concept of RNN gating versus the popular usage of multiplicative gating actually have a very diï¬ erent semantic meaning. Hypernetworks. Hypernetworks refer to neural networks whose parameters are themselves generated by smaller neural networks.'),\n",

Le 2017) used it in a narrow sense to deï¬ ne a large RNN whose recurrent parameters are generated by a smaller RNN. Data-dependence. Similar to hypernetworks, data-dependence can refer to any notion where some parameters of the model depend on the data (Poli et al. 2023). Example: GLU Activation. To illustrate the issues with these concepts, consider a simple diagonal linear layer ð ¦ = Dð ¥, where D is a diagonal weight parameter. Now suppose that D is itself generated from a linear transformation of ð ¥, with an optional nonlinearity: D = ð (W ð ¥). Since it is diagonal, the multiplication becomes an elementwise product: ð ¦ = ð (W ð ¥)â ¦ð ¥. This is a rather trivial transformation, yet it technically satisï¬ es the common meanings of gating (since it has a multiplicative â branchâ ), hypernetworks (since the parameter D is generated by another layer), and data-dependent (since D depends on the data ð ¥). However, this in fact simply deï¬ nes a GLU function, which is so simple that it is often considered just an activation function (Dauphin et al. 2017; Shazeer 2020) instead of a meaningful layer.'),\n",

More narrowly, we use selection to refer to the mechanistic action of a model to select or ignore inputs and facilitate data interaction along the sequence length (Section 3.1).

Lu et al. (2023) applied S5 to meta-RL in order to handle resetting the SSM state between episode trajectories. Their mechanism can be viewed as a particular hard-coded instance of a selection mechanism, where A is manually set to 0, instead of our learnable mechanism that depends on the input.

Additionally, older RNNs famously suï¬ ered from eï¬ ciency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Pascanu, Mikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The latter could be solved for some of the above RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the former was diï¬ cult without theory later developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs diï¬ er in more careful parameterization of the recurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g. through discretization (Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021; Gu, Johnson, Timalsina, et al. 2023)), or direct analysis (Orvieto et al. 2023)).

Performer (Choromanski et al. 2021) ï¬ nds an approximation to the exponential kernel involving only positive features, which also allows the softmax normalization term. TransNormer (Qin, Han, W.

We perform a parallel associative scan, yielding intermediate states of size (ð µ, ð ¿, ð ·, ð ) in SRAM. 4. We multiply and sum with C, producing outputs of size (ð µ, ð ¿, ð ·) and write it to HBM. This way, we reduce IOs by a factor of ð (ð ) (the state dimension), which in practice speeds up the operation by 20-40 times (Section 4.5). 28 Table 11: (Induction heads.)

However, these intermediate states are necessary for the backward pass to compute gradients. We instead recompute those intermediate states in the backward pass. Since the inputs â , A, B, C and output gradient read from HBM to SRAM are of size ð (ð µð ¿ð + ð ·ð ), and the input gradients are also of size ð (ð µð ¿ð + ð ·ð ), recomputation avoids the cost of reading ð (ð µð ¿ð ð ·) elements from HBM. This means that recomputation of the SSM states in the backward pass speeds up the computation compared to storing them and reading them from HBM. Beyond optimizing for the memory requirement of just the scan operation, we also use recomputation to optimize the memory requirement of the entire selective SSM block (input projection, convolution, activation, scan, output projection). In particular, we do not save intermediate activations that take a lot of memory but are fast to recompute (e.g. output of activation function or short convolution). As a result, the selective SSM layer has the same memory requirement as an optimized Transformer implementation with FlashAttention. In particular, each attention layer (FlashAttention) stores around 12 bytes of activations per token, an each MLP layer stores around 20 bytes of activations per token, for a total of 32 bytes ((assuming mixed-precision training in FP16 or BF16)). Each selective SSM stores around 16 bytes of activations per token. Hence two layers of selective SSMs have around the same activation memory as an attention layer and an MLP layer. # E Experimental Details and Additional Results # E.1 Synthetic Tasks Selective Copying.

The dataset follows the splits from the prior Enformer work on genomics (Avsec et al. 2021); the training split contains a total of ð = 34021 segments of length 217 = 131072 that cover the genome, for a total of approximately 4.5 billion tokens (DNA base pairs). These segments are pairs of (chromosome number, starting index, ending index), and can be extended if necessary (e.g. to get longer segments). We deviate from HyenaDNA when the training sequence length is not 217. HyenaDNA always takes a ï¬ xed sub-segment (e.g. the beginning or middle of the prescribed segment), and thus for any training sequence length each epoch is ï¬ xed to 34021 samples and doesnâ t necessarily go through the whole genome. On the other hand, we use the entire training data: â ¢ When the context length ð ¿ is less than (or equal to) 217, we divide up each segment into non-overlapping sub-segments of length ð ¿, so that there are ð Ã'),\n",

Owing to reliability concerns, these circumstances markedly hinder the practical deployment of LLMs. Furthermore, in specialized domains like medicine, law, finance, and jour- nalism, hallucination presents a significant to deployment [3], [4]. These fields require stringent standards of content timeliness, accuracy, and logical consistency, at- tributable to their dynamic and highly specialized character- istics.

In the pre-training phase, constraints in model parameters or training methodologies may engender parameter inaccuracies, thwarting the retrieval of accurate content.

While there have been initiatives to develop benchmarks for hallucination assessment, the majority of these methods employ restricted techniques to produce particular kinds of hallucinated utterances. This approach to generation is at odds with real-world scenarios where hallucinations may arise in unrestricted, spontaneously generated content.

The extensive lexicon of Chinese characters, combined with the complexities introduced by Chinese word segmentation, renders the Chinese hallucination evaluation particularly arduous and deserving of focused scrutiny. To address the aforementioned challenges, we introduce a novel benchmark for hallucination assessment, as depicted in Fig. 2. The benchmark dataset is comprised of news articles. Selecting texts from this domain is intentional, given that news requires utmost precision in conveying factual information and exhibits minimal tolerance for hallucinations. Constructing an evaluation dataset within this sphere presents a considerable challenge for the majority of LLMs. Concurrently, news arti- cles are of exceptional quality, readily available, and frequently employed as training corpora by a large number of LLMs, guaranteeing impartiality in the evaluation of many LLMs [1]. In light of these factors, we collected a considerable volume of raw news articles, established an efficient, professional-grade hallucination assessment dataset, and formulated an evaluation framework named UHGEval. It is significant to note that our dataset was produced in an entirely unconstrained fashion. We permit models to compose freely and subsequently sift through the content to identify hallucinations. Our contributions are as follows: (1) The development of an unconstrained hallucination evaluation dataset.

THE UHGEVAL BENCHMARK DATASET A. Data Collection and Pre-processing the news continuation dataset, we amassed tens of thousands of historical news articles from leading Chinese news websites, covering the period from January 2015 to January 2017, to serve as the foundation for constructing the dataset. It is worth noting that the decision to eschew the inclusion of more recent news articles (e.g., from 2023) was made to better assess the modelâ s understanding of existing knowledge and past news events. Indeed, the knowledge embedded within the training data of existing Chinese LLMs typically encompasses information pertaining to significant news between 2015 and 2017 [1]. Considering the different categories of news, such as sports, education, science, and society, the generated hallucinations typically exhibit certain differences. Therefore, when curating the initial news collection for continuation, we endeavored to ensure that the distribution of the collection aligns with the original distribution by randomly sampling from the entire news dataset. Furthermore, we have categorized the collected news examples into four major types: document-intensive, number-intensive, knowledge-intensive, and general news, as shown in Table I. We hypothesize that the likelihood of gen- erating hallucinations varies for different types of news. For example, number-intensive news frequently contains various numerical data, such as years, scores, and values, which may predispose the model to fabricating numbers or introducing minor deviations. Document-intensive news, on the other hand, primarily references official documents, such as factual policy documents, official statements, standard explanations, and legal clauses. In this case, the model may be inclined to fabricate specific policy or document names, or create detailed but fictional policy content. Knowledge-intensive news is characterized by an emphasis on enduring truths and analytical reasoning, which can render the model susceptible to flawed reasoning or the retrieval of incorrect facts. In addition to these three types, we also categorize culturally relevant general news as a separate category for experimental control. In the data pre-processing stage, we divide a complete news article into three parts: the beginning text, the following text, and the reference information. The beginning text serves to guide the model in generating the continuation and is typically the opening portion of the news.'),\n",

Unconstrained Hallucination Generation Historically, benchmarks for evaluating hallucination have predominantly relied on a single LLM to produce hallucinated dataset. Notable examples include HaluEval [6] and PHD [8], which exclusively utilize ChatGPT, and FActScore [9] and FACTOR [10], which solely employ InstructGPT [11]. In contrast, our methodology incorporates a suite of five distinct Chinese LLMs to generate hallucinated content. These mod- els include ChatGLM2-6B [12], Baichuan2-13B [13], Qwen- 14B [14], InternLM-20B [15], and the Xinyu series model, Xinyu-7B. Xinyu-7B is an augmented large-scale language model derived from the foundational BloomZ-7B [16] through continued pre-training, news-specific fine-tuning, and align- ment optimization. Furthermore, Xinyu2-70B is developed based on the open-source LLaMA2-70B [17] framework, incorporating expansions to the Chinese lexicon, ongoing pre- training, and news-specific fine-tuning, thereby endowing it with a robust foundational capability in the news domain. The Xinyu series models are the results of a collaborative research and development effort between the Institute for Advanced Algorithms Research, Shanghai (IAAR, SH), and the State Key Laboratory of Media Convergence Production Technology and Systems of the Xinhua News Agency. Xinyu-7B and Xinyu2-70B will also be utilized in the experiment phase.'),\n",

Upon generating the continuations, a straightforward reliance on human verifi- cation is infeasible. An exclusive dependence on human anno- tation would incur substantial costs and may not be sustainable at scale, whereas a purely machine-based approach, such as utilizing GPT4, could potentially yield less accurate results. To navigate these complexities, we have adopted a two- stage annotation methodology. This approach begins with an initial phase of hallucination ranking, which is designed to preliminarily sort the generated content based on the like- lihood of hallucination. The ranking is then followed by a combination of automatic labeling and human recheck. The integration of hallucination ranking and machine labeling serves a pivotal role in streamlining the subsequent human verification process. This hybrid approach aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of human checks, effectively bridging the gap between the scalability of automated processes and the critical discernment of human judgment. Hallucination ranking is a crucial step in the process of evaluating and selecting the most appropriate continuation from a set of candidate continuations generated by LLMs. The objective of this step is to identify a continuation that not only demonstrates high quality in terms of coherence and readability but also includes an appropriate level of hallucination â'),\n",

To assess fluency, a reward model developed by the Institute for Advanced Algorithms Research (IAAR) is employed.

For hallucination occurrence likelihood ranking, we evaluate the lexical correlation between the gener- ated continuation and the reference information. The lower the correlation, the more likely hallucinations are to occur. Despite existing lexical metrics based on n-gram coverage, such as BLEU [18] and ROUGE [19], we believe that these rule-based methods may not effectively discover hallucinated keywords. Therefore, we propose the keyword precision (kwPrec) metric. This approach initially uses an LLM (here, we use GPT3.5- Turbo) to extract keywords from the continuation and deter- mine whether these keywords have a match in the reference information. The ratio of all matches to the total keywords is then calculated. Since LLMs often extract appropriate keywords more effectively, kwPrec focuses more on factual relevance rather than expressional relevance. Fig. 3 illustrates the tokens segmented by our method compared to those obtained by BLEU-4 and ROUGE-L. After implementing this method, we calculate the kwPrec for each of the three candidate continuations, selecting the one with the lowest value as the final candidate. Through the screening in these two stages, we can ensure that, in the worst case scenario, the final candidate continuation ranks third in fluency and third in the likelihood of hallucination occurrence, achieving a balanced level. By considering both fluency and the likelihood of hallucina- tion, the process aims to filter out continuations that are either too nonsensical or too conservative (lacking any hallucinated content). The ideal candidate continuation would be one that is coherent and engaging but also contains a detectable level of hallucination, which can then be used for further analysis, such as studying the modelâ s tendencies to hallucinate or for training systems to detect and mitigate such hallucinations. The final candidate continuations will undergo further anno- tation to determine the presence and degree of hallucination, which can involve additional automated tools and human judgment. This multi-faceted approach helps ensure that the final selected continuation is both high-quality and relevant for the purposes of the hallucination evaluation benchmark.'),\n",

Discriminative evaluation enables LLMs to respond with bi- nary answers of â yesâ or â noâ [6], [24]. Specifically, this eval- uation modality involves presenting the LLM under scrutiny with an initial text followed by a continuation that may or may not include hallucinations. The LLM is tasked with producing a verdict as to the presence of hallucinations. Owing to the efficacy of few-shot prompting, this evaluation paradigm is relatively uncomplicated for LLMs to administer, as it facilitates the elicitation of the requisite responses. However, this method depends solely on the LLMâ s ability to draw upon the knowledge encoded within its parameters, necessitating the concurrent application of knowledge and reasoning, and thus requiring a robust foundational model capacity. Similar to discriminative evaluation, selective evaluation allows LLMs to tackle multiple-choice questions by choosing between option A or B, as exemplified by PandaLM [25]. Specifically, in selective evaluation, the LLM under evaluation is presented with an initial text followed by two continuations: one that includes hallucinations and another that does not. The LLMâ s objective is to identify which of the two is hallucinated. This assessment method offers the LLM more contextual information than discriminative evaluation, thereby alleviating the burden of fact-checking and lessening the dependence on retrieving facts from its parameters. Consequently, this reduces the level of difficulty for the LLM. However, both discriminative and selective evaluations en- counter a substantial challenge. They are predicated on the assumption that â'),\n",

Conse- quently, generative evaluation is crucial as it directly evaluates the presence of hallucinations in the text generated by the LLM. Specifically, the LLM under evaluation is provided with an initial text and is then tasked with generating a continuation. Subsequently, various reference-based techniques are utilized to determine if the continuation includes hallucinations. How- ever, the challenge arises from the fact that it is not feasible to automatically and accurately ascertain if newly generated text is hallucinated; if it were, annotated datasets would be redun- dant. In scenarios of unrestrained text generation, this issue becomes increasingly complex. This complexity stems from the fact that text generated without constraints may introduce a multitude of entities and facts absent in the reference material, complicating the verification of their accuracy. Despite these hurdles, generative evaluation continues to be a predominant strategy in Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks [26]. In terms of metrics, these include classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and others, which are applicable to human evaluation, discriminative evaluation, and selective evaluation. Generative evaluation, on the other hand, encom- passes both lexical and semantic metrics. Lexical metrics evaluate the extent of token overlap between the generated text and the reference information, including metrics such as BLEU [18], ROUGE [19], and the newly proposed kwPrec. Semantic metrics gauge the similarity in meaning between sentences, with examples including BERTScore [27], GPT- judge [28], and GPTScore [29], among others. In terms of granularity, evaluations can be conducted at both the sentence and keyword levels. Owing to our annotation methodology, our dataset is marked at the keyword level to signify instances of hallucinations. This approach affords a broader spectrum of possibilities for configuring the evaluation task, enabling the evaluated model to address the presence of hallucinations at either the sentence level or keyword level.'),\n",

To guarantee the reliability of experimental outcomes for all LLMs, we meticulously balance examples in discriminative and selective evaluations. Specifically, the LLM under evaluation will en- counter an equal number of examples with and without halluci- nations. This approach addresses the tendency of some models to learn patterns from the three examples in the prompts and produce conjectural rather than reasoned responses when mak- ing judgments. Such a tendency can introduce a considerable bias towards certain outcomes. An imbalance could complicate the analysis of experimental outcomes. Hyperparameter settings.

Discussion Each of the three evaluation methods possesses distinct advantages and drawbacks. Discriminative evaluation is often the method of choice for a range of standard benchmarks [6], [24]. This approach is intuitive, and the construction of evalua- tion prompts is straightforward. Selective evaluation resembles discriminative evaluation but is marginally less demanding because it includes a reference option for contrast. In both discriminative and selective evaluations, certain models might be suspected of conjecturing answers from few shots due to in- adequate reasoning skills, which can undermine the reliability of the outcomes. Consequently, the use of explainable prompt- ing becomes essential. Generative evaluation most closely mir- rors real-world applications. However, the generated content is unrestricted, which poses challenges for even the most dependable reference-based evaluation techniques. Therefore, employing a combination of metrics simultaneously, including lexical evaluation based on token coverage and semantic evaluation based on textual similarity, is imperative. The foundational capabilities required of LLMs can be arrayed on a spectrum from simple to complex: generative, selective, and discriminative evaluation. Generative evaluation entails the direct invocation of parameters for continuation, bypassing the need for an extensive grasp of instructions, which suits models with minimal fine-tuning. Selective evalu- ation necessitates a degree of inferential reasoning but offers comparative choices, rendering the level of difficulty moderate. Conversely, discriminative evaluation demands the precise re- trieval of factual information, thereby increasing the challenge. Moreover, various evaluations cater to different application contexts. Should the objective be to solely improve the modelâ s capacity for reliable continuation, generative evaluation would suffice. In the training of a dependable chatbot, selective and discriminative evaluations prove suitable. When aiming to train a reward model, selective evaluation is beneficial, offering evaluation for positive and negative instances. If the goal is to enhance the modelâ s ability to recall and apply knowledge, discriminative evaluation emerges as the demanding option. # IV. RELATED WORKS A.'),\n",

A PLM is a language model trained on extensive unlabeled textual data to discern under- lying patterns, structures, and semantic knowledge within the corpus. Conversely, an SFT model involves further training a PLM with labeled datasets tailored to a specific task, with the goal of improving performance in that area. Many open-source models, including LLaMA, GLM, and Qwen, have made their PLM weights publicly available. For SFT models, users can access the chat variants of open-source models or the API services provided by closed-source models. In our research, we focus primarily on evaluating closed-source GPT series models and open-source Chinese chat models.'),\n",

Hallucinations in LLM Despite remarkable advancements in LLMs, they continue to encounter challenges, with hallucination being one of the most notable. Hallucination in language models refers to generating content that strays from factual accuracy, leading to unreliable outputs. Hallucinations occur when the generated content is not aligned with user input, deviates from the modelâ s previous outputs, or is at odds with established real- world knowledge [5]. Specific examples include inaccuracies in age, currency, scores, and other numerical values; citing fictional statements; inventing non-existent characters; and muddling timelines by merging events from different peri- ods [2]. Regarding the causes of hallucinations, several factors can be responsible [5]. One contributing factor is the use of inaccurate or incomplete training data. During training, LLMs fine-tune their parameters with vast quantities of text data. However, this data may be flawed, harboring errors, inaccuracies, or gaps in information. Another factor involves inconsistencies in contextual information. While LLMs typi- cally consider previously generated context when producing content, challenges in managing long-term dependencies or understanding complex contexts can result in inconsistencies. Additionally, hallucinations can arise from lacking or erro- neous world knowledge. Although LLMs gain considerable'),\n",

Furthermore, model limitations, in- cluding generation strategies and alignment methods, can also play a role in hallucinations during content creation. C. Hallucination Evaluation Benchmarks To more effectively tackle the issue of hallucinations, con- structing evaluation benchmarks is essential. In this context, numerous outstanding contributions have surfaced. This sec- tion reviews existing contributions regarding the development of benchmark datasets, their characteristics, and the particular methodologies for evaluation. Basic information about these benchmarks is presented in Table VII. while a few examine them at the word (or keyword, concept) the majority of datasets level. With respect cover the general domain, while some benchmarks target specific domains; for instance, HaLoCheck [34] focuses on the NBA, Med-HALT [37] on medicine, and our UHGEval on news. Concerning language, most evaluation datasets are in English. To our knowledge, the only two Chinese benchmarks, ChineseFactEval [32] and HalluQA [24], contain only 125 and 450 questions, respectively. Given the notably limited size of these datasets, our work significantly enhances the pool of data available for Chinese hallucination evaluation. Benchmark dataset construction. Dataset construction usually involves three steps. Firstly, real-world texts for hal- lucination generation are collected, and most benchmarks directly use existing datasets, such as Wiki [10], Alpaca [6], PubMed [37], Quora [38] and so on. Secondly, hallucinations are generated usually by LLMs such as GPT3.5-Turbo, and most works uses constrained hallucination generation (CHG) paradigm [10], [9], [34], [6], [2], [8], [38]. STSN [39] and XSum Hallu [40] are the only two benchmarks that use UHG as we do. Thirdly, it is not certain that the content generated by the LLMs actually contains hallucinations, and often requires annotation, which is mostly done by human involvement. There are also works using automatic machine labeling [10], [35], [24], [6], [36]. These are the basic methods for con- structing datasets, but there are also some other paradigms, such as constructing the dataset purely using manual labor, e.g.'),\n",

Regarding the granu- larity of hallucinations labeled in the datasets, most studies assess hallucinations at the sentence and document levels, Evaluation scheme. Existing works use a variety of ways to measure hallucinations. However, due to cost and time constraints, building automatic metrics for evaluation is still dominant, and a small proportion of works use human evalua- tion [9], [28], [40]. In terms of specific evaluation metrics, most works adopt common classification metrics, e.g., F1, accuracy, precision, recall. some other works construct their own calculation methods, e.g., FACTOR [10], FActScore [9], HaLoCheck [34], HVI [2], etc. However, the above metrics are rule-based and can only evaluate the ability of LLMs to classify hallucinations, but not the ability of LLMs to gen- erate content without hallucinations. Thus, some benchmarks explore even further in generative evaluation. For example, KoLA [36] evaluates knowledge creation (KC) using BLEU and ROUGE to measure the degree of overlap between the output and the reference, TruthfulQA [28] evaluates hallu- cinations using a specially trained classifier, GPT-judge, and FactualityPrompts [35] simultaneously employs a hallucinated named entity error based on n-gram coverage and a semantic- based entailment ratio.'),\n",

CONCLUSION LLMs are experiencing a rapid evolution, heralding a new era of potential applications within the realm of professional content generation. The progression of LLMs in this domain necessitates the establishment of robust benchmarks to steer their development effectively. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset using unconstrained hallucination generation, comprising a dataset specifically curated for hal- lucinated news continuation, which encompasses in excess of 5,000 instances annotated at the keyword level. Additionally, we propose a secure, scalable, and user-friendly evaluation framework to facilitate comprehensive assessments. Through meticulous experimentation on eleven prominent LLMs, our study has unearthed a series of enlightening findings. Looking ahead, our research endeavors will persist in exploring the intricacies of hallucination phenomena within professional content generation. Concurrently, on the benchmarking front, we aspire to augment our datasets to encompass a more diverse spectrum of domains and linguistic variations, thereby broadening the applicability and relevance of our benchmarks.'),\n",

An effective thought design should consider three key perspectives: performance, efficiency, and flexibility. How- ever, existing thought can at most exhibit two of these attributes. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel thought prompting approach called â Everything â of existing thought of Thoughtsâ (XOT) to defy the law of â Penrose triangle paradigms. XOT leverages pretrained reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to incorporate external domain knowledge into thoughts, thereby enhancing LLMsâ capabilities and enabling them to generalize to unseen problems efficiently. Through the utilization of the MCTS-LLM collaborative thought revision framework, this approach autonomously produces high-quality comprehensive cognitive mappings with minimal LLM interactions. Additionally, XOT empowers LLMs to engage in unconstrained thinking, allowing for flexible cognitive mappings for problems with multiple solutions. We evaluate XOT on several challenging problem-solving tasks, including Game of 24, 8-Puzzle, and Pocket Cube. Our results demonstrate that XOT significantly outperforms existing approaches in various dimensions, showcasing its remark- able proficiency in addressing complex problems across diverse domains.'),\n",

Performance is the accuracy of the solution to a problem, including the precision of each thought at intermediate stages. This metric holds paramount importance for problem-solving. 1 â ¢ Efficiency. Efficiency relates to the number of LLM inference calls required to solve a single problem. Minimizing this aspect is crucial due to the high computational cost associated with LLM inference, thereby reducing the overall number of cost. â ¢ Flexibility. Flexibility in thought topology refers to the diverse structures that can be employed by LLMs when organizing thoughts for problem-solving. These structures may include chains, trees, or even graphs, mirroring human thought processes. Enabling more flexible thought struc- tures enhances the capacity of LLMs for divergent and creative thinking, which is particularly advantageous in addressing complex problems, especially those with multiple potential solutions. There exist several thought generation paradigms, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Wei et al. (2022), Tree-of-Thought (ToT) Yao et al. (2023), and Graph-of-Thought (GoT), etc.. However, these paradigms each have their limitations and cannot simultaneously achieve all the three desired attributes, as illustrated in Table 1. Specifically, direct Input-Output (IO) prompting is suitable pri- marily for simple problem-solving scenarios with single-step processes, lacking both in performance and flexibility. CoT and self-consistency CoT (CoT-SC) enable step-by-step problem solving, result- ing in modest performance improvements, but they are confined to linear thought structures, limiting their flexibility. In contrast, ToT and GoT permit more versatile thought topologies, accommodating tree-like or graph-like structures. However, these paradigms require the evaluation of intermediate thought steps through LLM itself, incurring significant computational costs and inefficiencies due to multiple LLM calls. These paradigms are constrained by a law analogous to the â Penrose triangle â , wherein they can achieve a maximum of two out of the three attributes, and none of them can We propose a novel solution called â Everything of Thoughtsâ'),\n",

It leverages MCTS for proficient and efficient thought exploration while harnessing the capabilities of LLMs to refine and amend the thoughts derived from MCTS. This synergistic interaction creates a mutually beneficial arrangement, ultimately enabling the successful resolution of intricate problems characterized by high levels of performance, efficiency, and flexibility. 3.1 XOT IN A NUTSHELL We present an overview of the architecture of XOT in Fig. 1 (f). XOT comprises two key compo- nents: (i) a MCTS module guided by policy/value networks; and (iii) an LLM solver for thought revision and inference. The MCTS and policy/value networks need to be trained and then generalize to the inference process. During the training phase, MCTS is harnessed to explore potential thought structures for a spe- cific task through simulated scenarios. This process entails the recording of states, values, and the visitation frequencies of thought nodes in each simulation. These recorded data are subsequently employed to iteratively train the policy and value estimation model, enabling it to assimilate domain knowledge and comprehend the world model. Once trained, the estimated policy and value are utilized to guide the MCTS to systematically search for a thought trajectory provided to aid LLMs in problem-solving. Note that thoughts extracted only play a supporting role, assisting LLMs in gathering knowledge from external sources. These thoughts do not provide LLMs with definitive or error-free answers, as they may contain inaccu- racies or suboptimal solutions. LLMs are responsible for review and refining these thoughts when they seem erroneous or require adjustments. They continue MCTS the search process if needed'),\n",

Each sub-step aims to alter the current status of the problem, eventually culminating in the successful resolution of the overarching problem. This approach, as seen in ToT and GoT, hinges on well-defined state tran- sitions and clear final objectives. Consequently, it is natural to conceptualize the thought-searching process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) Puterman (1990), in which:'),\n",

The initial state s0 corresponds to the original problem, while intermediate states are characterized by either decomposed sub-problems or the results stemming from their resolution. â ¢ Action at: Signifies the one-step solution or action associated with tackling a problem, leading to a transition to a new state, by incorporating their outcomes. â ¢ Reward r: Reflects the comprehensive evaluation of the solution to the original problem, assess- ing whether it has been effectively resolved through the process of problem decomposition. â ¢ Thought Ï : A one-step thought is a combination of one-step state and action, i.e., Ï = {s, a}. This formulation naturally encapsulates the process of decomposing a complex problem into multiple sub-tasks, each accompanied by their respective outcomes. The detailed definitions of state, action, reward and thought for each task are shown in Table 1. The generation of complete thoughts T = {Ï 1, Â· Â· Â· , Ï N }, can be construed as the endeavor to discover a thought trajectory to maximize the accumulated reward to address the overall problem. 3.3 THOUGHTS SEARCHING WITH MCTS The formulation above naturally aligns the thought within LLM as a state-action pair. This approach facilitates the effective exploration of its optimal trajectory using a combination of MCTS and RL. This adheres to an iterative simulation cycle that encompasses three key phases: selection, expansion & evaluation, and backpropagation. It heavily depends on the utilization of neural networks fÎ¸, which simultaneously estimate the value and action probability for a given state st. The aim is to reduce the number of rollouts and accelerate the search process, similar to the approach employed in AlphaGo Zero Silver et al. (2017). We provide a visual representation of an iteration of the MCTS in Fig. 2 (a)-(c) by taking Pocket Cube as an example and detail each process below. Selection. In the selection phase, the algorithm initiates at the root node and proceeds to choose an action aâ from the available set A(s) for single-step thought generation in the current state s. This process continues until a leaf node within the current tree is reached. The selection is guided by the PUCT algorithm Rosin (2011), aiming to maximize the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) Garivier 4 & Moulines (2011), as follows:'),\n",

These updates occur as infor- mation is backpropagated along the trajectory to subsequent nodes.

Subsequently, we can train a combined policy and value network fÎ¸ to minimize the discrepancy between the predicted value vÎ¸(s) and the actual value v(s), while also maximizing the alignment between the action probabilities produced by the neural network PÎ¸(s) and the search probabilities Îµ(s). This can be achieved by minimizing the following loss function: L = (v(s) â vÎ¸(s))2 + Îµ(s)T log PÎ¸(s)). This training iterates alongside the simulation process to continually enhance the performance of fÎ¸, resulting in progressive improvements in thought searching capabilities. 3.4 THOUGHT INFERENCE WITH MCTS Once trained, we utilize the fÎ¸ to guide the MCTS in generating a thought for a new problem, which assists the LLM in solving it. Specifically, MCTS is utilized to perform K simulations aimed at thought searching and problem-solving, as illustrated in Fig.2 (d). In each simulation, fÎ¸ is em- ployed to guide the MCTS in its search for a thought trajectory. Throughout the training process, fÎ¸ incorporates external information related to the state and action quality. This information helps LLMs understand the world model, enhancing their long-term reasoning and planning abilities, which are areas they may not excel in Stechly et al. (2023); Valmeekam et al. (2023), thereby ensur- ing the performance of thought generation.

This demonstrates that XOT is capable of generating thought structures with flexibility. These trajectories are then transformed into text sequences that are concatenated to form a prompt sequence provided to LLMs. Note that the thought trajectory is concatenated into a single prompt, even in the case of problems with multiple solutions.

It is important to acknowledge that that MCTS may not always provide the globally optimal thought trajectory to directly solve the problem flawlessly. Therefore, the thoughts extracted from MCTS serve as a reference thinking process for the problem, aiding LLMs in a sup- portive capacity. The LLMs will leverage their internal knowledge to review the extracted thought, identify errors in the thought trajectory, and then ground its knowledge in collaboration with the MCTS to revise and refine the thought. The revision process is iterative in nature, as shown in Fig. 3. Initially, upon obtaining the extracted thought, we instruct the LLM to detect any errors in the thought generated by MCTS using its in- ternal knowledge. If the LLM identifies an error, it results in an error state denoted as se within the thought. If no error is found, the thought remains unchanged. Starting from the parent state of se, MCTS conducts an additional set of L simulations, ultimately yielding a revised thought for the LLM. In scenarios involving multiple solutions, each solution undergoes this process individually. Upon the completion of the revision, we supply the LLMs with the revised thoughts for problem- solving. The revision process can be repeated several times to enhance the reliability of the answer. This collaborative MCTS-LLM framework nurtures a mutually beneficial process for both compo- nents, ultimately contributing to the overall performance of problem-solving. Since LLMs are solely utilized for identifying errors during the revision process with only one call, the efficiency of XOT is effectively maintained. The collaborative revision framework harnesses the strengths of both MCTS and LLMs. MCTS efficiently and flexibly generates candidate thoughts for LLMs through simulations, while LLMs use their internal knowledge to revise and ground these thoughts within the MCTS framework, effectively turning MCTS into a world model for LLMs. This process ensures the generation of high-quality thoughts for problem-solving. # 4 EXPERIMENT We conduct an extensive evaluation of our XOT approach2 in comparison to several baseline meth- ods across three challenging tasks: the Game of 24, the 8-Puzzle (with a 3 Ã 3 grid), and the 2 Ã 2 Pocket Cube.

In the case of CoT, we augment each input-output pair by including three intermediate equations. As for ToT, we solicit one-step thought candidates from the LLM at each step, subsequently instructing the LLM to categorize each thought candidate for intermediate selection. For experimental comparison, we conduct experiments on both the top-1 candidate (with b=1) and the top-3 candidates (with b=3) being retained, where b indicates the branches retained for exploration at each step. For GoT, we employ LLM to generate one-step thought candidates in the same manner as ToT, then we direct the LLM to select the top-1 thought from all candidates for merging the thoughts. We also examine a CoT-SC baseline, which derives the majority output from 10 CoT samples. For XOT, we perform 200 simulations for each action taken, and this count is increased to 500 during the thought revision process. In the multi-solution scenario, the IO, CoT, and CoT-SC prompts each include 5 examples, with each problem having 1 to 3 different solutions. For ToT, the top-3 candidates (with b=3) at the final step are considered as different solutions. Rather than keeping only the top-1 thought, GoT is instructed to select between 1 to 3 thoughts from all candidates at each step to generate a wider range of solutions. As for XOT, after performing simulations on MCTS, we sample 500 thought trajectories as for exploration and remove deplicates.

In the CoT approach, each input-output pair is enriched by incorporating intermediate legal action sets, the current action, and the current state. In ToT, at each stage, a set of one-step thought candidates are derived from the LLM, from the current set of legal actions. We impose a maximum step limit of 9 since all generated problems can be solved within this range. The 8-puzzleâ s rules are conveyed through a system message, including detailed explanations of each actionâ s execution. Similarly, we perform 20 simulations for each action taken with XOT, and increase this number to 50 for thought revision processes. In the multi-solution scenario, all of the IO, CoT, and CoT-SC prompts consist of four examples. Each problem is presented with one to three distinct solutions. For ToT (b=3) and GoT (k=3), the maximum number of steps is increased to 12, as correct solutions may not always be optimal and could exceed 9 steps.

As expected, most of the baselines show very poor performance in this task, with some baselines achieving 0% accuracy. The best-performing base- line, ToT (b=3) with GPT-4, only attains a success rate of 19.57%. In contrast, XOT can achieve over 45% accuracy without revision and over 75% accuracy with revision, establishing itself as an expert in solving this task. This success is attributed to the injection of external knowledge from MCTS, enabling LLMs to solve problems that they would struggle with on their own.

In Fig. 4, we compare the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models using the XOT method with varying numbers of revisions, ranging from 0 to 3, across all three tasks. In the Game of 24 task, as the number of revisions increases, both models exhibit improved per- formance. Notably, GPT-3.5 consistently outperforms GPT-4 in terms of accuracy. After three revisions, GPT-3.5 achieves an accuracy of 90.51%, while GPT-4 reaches 85.40%. This improved performance comes at the cost of increased inference times and model calls, primarily driven by the need for more interactions to generate revised thoughts. For the 8-Puzzle task, the trend of in- creasing accuracy with more revisions remains valid. However, in this task, GPT-4 significantly outperforms GPT-3.5. After one revision, GPT-4 achieves an accuracy of 93.28%, which increases to 95.8% after the third revision. In contrast, GPT-3.5 only attains an accuracy of 63.03% after the third revision. In the Pocket Cube task, the performance trend is similar. The accuracy of both mod- els improves with an increase in the number of revisions. GPT-3.5 starts at an accuracy of 45.36% without revision and improves to 84.70% after three revisions. GPT-4 begins with an accuracy of 45.9% and reaches 83.61% after three revisions. Inference times and model calls are comparable between the two models, with GPT-4 showing a substantial increase in model calls after the third revision.

We present the performance comparison for all three tasks in Table 9. Note that we only compare ToT and GoT since other baselines do not support this comparison by their nature. The results clearly show that incomplete thoughts lead to a significant performance drop in all three tasks. GPT-3.5 is more affected than GPT-4, with GPT-3.5 achieving 0% accuracy on several base- lines. In contrast, XOT with GPT-4 attains satisfactory performance on the Game of 24 and 8- Puzzle, achieving over 40% accuracy. However, the performance of XOT is dramatically affected in the Pocket Cube task, with accuracy dropping to 6%. This demonstrates that for very complex tasks, LLMs are highly sensitive to the completeness of the thoughts provided. Missing steps in the thought can lead to a substantial drop in performance, highlighting the importance of providing complete thoughts for such tasks. 4.5 CASE STUDY Finally, in Fig. 5, we provide examples of thought structures generated by XOT for all three tasks in the multi-solution scenario. It is noteworthy that, owing to the multiple solutions required, the generated thoughts intertwine during intermediate steps and converge towards the final goal state.

In the case of the Pocket Cube, XOT identifies four distinct pathways to reach the goal state, leading to successful problem-solving across multiple solutions. Overall, these cases highlight how XOT encapsulates the flexibility required in thought generation, fostering diverse and creative thinking for LLMs. This enables them to produce multiple high- quality answers to a single problem effectively. 4.6 EXPERIMENT SUMMARY In summary, our approach XOT significantly improves the performance of LLMs by introducing a streamlined thought trajectory revision process. This represents a fundamental shift from traditional problem-solving approaches, resulting in substantial performance enhancements across a range of tasks. Notably, XOT excels in solving the Game of 24 and demonstrates its ability to overcome challenges requiring spatial reasoning, such as the 8-Puzzle and Pocket Cube, which were previously challenging for LLMs. The remarkable synergy of improved performance, efficiency, and flexibility exhibited by XOT positions it as an exemplary and superior method for eliciting optimal responses from LLMs. 5 RELATED WORK Decision Making & Planning with LLMs. The utilization of LLMs for decision-making and plan- ning has become a prominent area of research. Similar to human problem-solving, the process in- volves breaking down complex problems into sub-tasks. Various frameworks, such as CoT Wei et al. (2022), ToT Yao et al. (2023), and GoT Besta et al. (2023), have been designed to facilitate prob- lem decomposition in different structural forms, leading to enhanced solutions derived from LLMs. Extensions of these frameworks have also been explored across different domains and modalities Zhang et al. (2022; 2023); Ning et al. (2023); Turpin et al. (2023); Long (2023).

Similarly, GLAM Carta et al. (2023) employs online RL to establish alignment between LLMsâ knowledge and the broader environment, thus enhancing their ability to generalize to new objects or tasks and ultimately improving their performance. Additionally, an interesting study in Yuan et al. (2023) utilizes RL to acquire basic skills in the context of Minecraft Cipollone et al.

This empowers LLMs to effectively tackle multimodal tasks and provides robust visual alignment and rapid inference speeds while preserving the textual domain.

The MCTS utilized in XOT is particularly suitable for such tasks and can therefore generalize to more complex problems. We also note that MCTS is functioning in a supportive role and can be substituted with alternative supervised or RL models for thought exploration and generation, which can serve as a copilot to inject domain knowledge of the real- world model to LLMs. This opens up a promising avenue for future research, enabling LLMs to engage in more effective planning and problem solving processes. Limitation We also note that the implementation of XOT necessitates the training of additional pol- icy and value models to expedite the inference process. This training process requires the acquisition of datasets from real-world environments, introducing supplementary costs and efforts. However, note that these policy and value models are considerably smaller and more computationally efficient than the underlying LLMs. Consequently, the incurred costs are deemed low, particularly in the con- text of tasks featured in this study, where the thought steps and objectives are well-defined. In future research endeavors, we intend to explore methods to enhance the efficiency of the training process for XOT in scenarios where the objectives are less straightforward, such as multi-agent planning and code generation tasks Talebirad & Nadiri (2023); Vaithilingam et al. (2022). This endeavor will expand the applicability of the proposed XOT framework to a broader range of applications.

Currently, the main alignment approach is based on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Despite the effectiveness of RLHF, it is intricate to implement and train, thus recent studies explore how to develop al- ternative alignment approaches based on supervised fine-tuning (SFT). A major limitation of SFT is that it essentially does imitation learning, which cannot fully understand what are the expected behaviors. To address this issue, we propose an improved alignment approach named FIGA. Different from prior methods, we incorporate fine-grained (i.e., token or phrase level) quality signals that are derived by contrasting good and bad responses. Our approach has made two ma- jor contributions. Firstly, we curate a refined alignment dataset that pairs initial responses and the corresponding revised ones. Secondly, we devise a new loss function can leverage fine-grained quality signals to instruct the learning of LLMs for alignment. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approaches by comparing a number of competitive baselines.'),\n",

While after large-scale pre-training, it often needs subsequent tuning for enhancing and regulating the behaviors of LLMs. Two typical approaches are supervised fine- tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which can largely improve LLMs in both task solving capacity and human alignment (Ouyang et al., 2022). Despite widely explored, SFT and RLHF have their own strengths and weaknesses (Zhao et al., 2023a). On the one hand, SFT is easy to implement and can effectively boost the general task solving abilities by instruction based eliciting (Wei et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022), while it mainly imitates the behaviors of experts (essentially doing behavior clone (Wiseman & Rush, 2016)), which are demonstrated by the human annotators or powerful LLMs such as ChatGPT. Therefore, the SFT performance highly relies on high-quality demonstration data (Zhou et al., 2023), and might suffer from the huge distribution shifts between its outputs and imitated outputs (Zhang et al., 2019; Schulman, 2023). On the other hand, RLHF can better explore the semantic space of LLMs, and identify the optimal policy by encouraging good behaviors and discouraging bad behaviors during learning. However, it is very complicated to effectively implement, often suffering from training instability issues such as reward collapse (Song et al., 2023; Wolf et al., 2023). To leverage the benefits of SFT and RLHF, several recent studies propose to develop alignment ap- proaches without reinforcement learning (RL). These studies typically construct refined instruction data using methods such as quantile ranking (Lu et al., 2022) and rejection-sampling (Touvron et al.,'),\n",

Another line of research designs alternative optimization approaches that bypasses reward modeling (Rafailov et al., 2023). To con- duct effective alignment without RL, a key issue is how to effectively learn by discriminating good and bad behaviors as that in RLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022), such that LLMs can understand what are good behaviors to follow and what are bad behaviors to avoid. Despite the prior efforts, they are largely limited by response-level discrimination signals: they are only aware of the quality label (e.g., good or bad) of a demonstration but not what makes it good or bad.'),\n",

In this work, we introduce FIGA, a novel method that aligns language models with human prefer- ences. The core idea is to contrast a low-quality initial response from a LLMâ s output with a cor- responding high-quality revised response by another powerful LLM (e.g., ChatGPT), so that LLMs can be noted with what are newly added (good actions) and what are removed or substituted (bad actions) from such a revision process. Such fine-grained quality signals can be more useful than the widely used response-level quality signal. It can instruct LLMs to emphasize the learning of good actions and penalize the bad actions in a single response. To implement our approach, we first cu- rate an alignment dataset called SPA that pairs an initial response with a revised response under the guidance of the ground-truth demonstrations. We mainly keep the queries that a LLM performs less well on, and perform strict filtering. Further, we design a new fine-tuning method that assigns spe- cific token-level weights to different parts (e.g., good or bad tokens). Our learning loss can directly impose fine-grained reward scores to guide the learning of LLMs for improved alignment. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt that leverages fine-grained quality signals for improving the alignment of LLMs without RL. Our approach can make LLMs better understand what are good and bad behaviors beyond simple imitation. By conducting extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FIGA shows promising performance in aligning language models with human preferences: our approach outperform the initial supervised-finetuned model by notable 3.2 points and the strong PPO method by 1.8 points. # 2 RELATED WORK In this section, we review the related work in the two aspects, namely reinforcement learning from human feedback and alignment without reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning from human feedback Large-scale pre-training empowers large lan- guage models (LLMs) to acquire extensive knowledge, underscoring their remarkable potential across diverse tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Kojima et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022). Nonetheless, models exclusively focus on next token prediction in pre-training phrase, while do not consider human preferences.'),\n",

The current mainstream approaches (Ouyang et al., 2022) to better harness the capabili- ties of LLMs include supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). To be specific, this involves three stages: firstly, using SFT to enable the model to better follow human instructions; subsequently, training a reward model (RM) using human preference data; and ultimately, tune the model to maximize the reward through the proximal policy optimiza- tion (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) algorithm. Furthermore, there are works exploring enhancement for this process (Ramamurthy et al., 2022; Lightman et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2023). However, RLHF presents challenges due to complex coding and hyper-parameters selecting. Besides, it requires load- ing three to four models simultaneously, resulting in high memory usage. These challenges propel researchers to explore alternative approaches to align language models with human feedback. Alignment without reinforcement learning Several studies are based on the rationale that lan- guage models have already acquired comprehensive knowledge during the pre-training, and only high-quality supervised fine-tuning data is required for further tuning (Zhou et al., 2023). So these works (Liu et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2022b; Bhardwaj & Poria, 2023; Krishna et al., 2022) bypass reward modeling, and instead concentrate on the construction of datasets that align well with human preferences. Other works are directed towards exploring substitutes for the intri- cate PPO algorithm. These efforts employ diverse approaches to learn from the preference data, encompassing the creation of a supervised fine-tuning training dataset enriched with human prefer-'),\n",

However, the human preference information used in these methods is at the sentence level, lacking more fine-grained supervision signals. # 3 APPROACH In this section, we present the proposed alignment approach FIGA by leveraging fine-grained qual- ity signals. Our approach is developed based on a specially curated alignment dataset called SPA (Section 3.1), where each low-quality initial response is paired with a high-quality revised response. Based on such an alignment dataset, we further develop a new loss function that incorporates fine- grained quality signals derived by contrasting good and bad responses (Section 3.2). Our approach is easy to implement (similar to SFT) and can capture the underlying effect to generate high-quality responses instead of simply imitating them (similar to RLHF), which are discussed in Section 3.3. The overall framework of our FIGA pipeline is shown in Figure 1.'),\n",

We carefully construct the SubPar Alignment (SPA) dataset, a curated collection of query, modelâ s initial response, and the corresponding improved response (with minor revision). Compared with prior work (Ouyang et al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a), we mainly consider the queries where LLMsâ performance are not satisfactory and aim to correct these bad cases via specific train- ing. Moreover, we refine the initial response of a LLM that is to be aligned as training target, which can effectively reduce the distribution shifts from the ground-truth demonstrations. Formally, we denote the initial model as Ï Î¸, which can be a supervised-finetuned model (e.g., Al- paca (Taori et al., 2023)) or a pre-trained base model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a)). To construct our dataset, we assume that a reward model for assessing the alignment level is available. In practice, a number of reward models have been released publicly (e.g., DeBERTa (OpenAssis- tant, 2023)), which can be used for our approach. Given a query X and a response Y , we leverage a reward model RM to compute the reward score RY = RM(X, Y ), which reflects how well the response Y aligns with given query X.'),\n",

Rollout for initial response generation We first broadly collect existing paired datasets encom- passing a wide range of real-world tasks, and construct the instances pool D = {X, Y }n i=1. To better align with human value, we select preference datasets (e.g., HH-RLHF (Bai et al., 2022a)) that adhere to the 3H principle (i.e., helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness) in this work. Further- more, we also include instruction dataset (e.g., OpenOrca (Mukherjee et al., 2023)) to preserve the task solving abilities of LLMs. We aim to train a both capable and safe model like ChatGPT, rather than only focusing on alignment while sacrificing the task solving abilities. Based on these datasets, we employ the rollout model Ï Î¸ to generate initial responses Ë Y = Ï Î¸(X) for the given queries. Identifying the queries to be enhanced After obtaining the modelâ s initial response Ë Y and the human-preferred response Y , we next identify the queries where the model requires further im- provement to better align with human intent through the reward score RM(Â·). Following existing work (Ouyang et al., 2022), we employ the reward model as a surrogate of human preferences, and design a filtering process based on the calculated reward score R Ë Y and RY for all the instances. We only keep the instances that meet all the three following restrictions: (1) R Ë Y < Î·1 (a subpar initial performance, i.e., bad cases), (2) RY > Î·2 (high-quality demonstrations), and (3) RY â R Ë Y > Î·3 (clear quality difference), where Î·1, Î·2, and Î·3 are three threshold values for filtering, we will set them according to the reward score distribution. The details can be found in Section 4.1.2. With the above filtering mechanism, we ensure the quality and usefulness of our SPA dataset. We target at bad case correction of the rollout model, which is more directed and effective than existing methods that directly trains the model on the whole collected dataset.'),\n",

Our solution is to revise the initial response ( Ë Y ) by referring to the ground-truth demonstration (Yi).

In detail, we leverage ChatGPT to determine, given Yi, which of the four reasons Ë Y is associated with. Afterwards, we design different prompts for the four reasons and instruct the LLM to make minor correction to the initial response Ë Y based on Yi. We denote the revised response as Ë Y . The details of our process and prompts can be found in Appendix A.2. Finally, we obtain the SPA dataset {X, Ë Y , Ë Y } for subsequent training.

Note that we keep both the initial and revised responses in a contrastive form, because they are jointly used for deriving fine-grained quality signals in subsequent training. 3.2 FINE-GRAINED QUALITY-AWARE ALIGNMENT TUNING As described above, our fine-tuning dataset for alignment contains both low-quality initial responses ( Ë Y ) and high-quality revised responses ( Ë Y ). Instead of directly learning from these high-quality responses (similar to rejection sampling (Touvron et al., 2023b)), it is important for LLMs to under- stand why such revisions are useful to produce the high-quality responses. Furthermore, LLMs can improve the alignment capacity from the contrast between good and bad responses. Motivated by previous work (Liu et al., 2022), we utilize Levenshtein distance to quantify the simi- larity between of Ë Y and Ë Y .'),\n",

Relationship with RL Our method can be considered as a simplified but efficient version of RL. Using typical PPO method (Schulman et al., 2017) as an example, its objective is to optimize the actor model (i.e., the initial model Ï Î¸) to maximize the expected reward score, formally given as: fielder, X) PPO = (Zan â Ay ) ; 3 Â» Tous (GelG<t,X) â where AË yt is the advantage function of the Ë yt token returned by the critic model given the reward score R Ë Y . Ï Î¸old is the model before the previous parameter update. Here, we ignore the clipping function and KL penalty for convenience. Considering the FIGA training objective in Equation 2, our weight functions Ë r(Â·) and Ë r(Â·) in FIGA can be viewed as a simplified advantage function A(Â·) in Equation 3 to evaluate the importance of each token. Therefore, FIGA has a similar objective with RL but with a simplified token-wise reward function. We do not use an extra learned critic model and remove the use of previous rollout model, which makes FIGA more efficient. In the later experiment section, we will verify the effectiveness of our method. # 4 EXPERIMENT 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 4.1.1 BASELINE METHODS (1) In order to better evaluate FIGA method, we choose several baselines for comparison: SFT (Ouyang et al., 2022): it continues to fine-tune the initial model using pairs of data with sequence-to-sequence loss. (2) PPO (Ouyang et al., 2022): it optimizes the initial model to achieve a higher reward score provided by the reward model through the PPO algorithm.

(4) RRHF (Yuan et al., 2023): it applies SFT on the optimal responses, and further optimizes the ranking loss among responses from multiple sources by encouraging the model to achieve a greater conditional log probability for the response that holds a superior ranking. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS Training Datasets For our SPA dataset mentioned in Section 3.1, we broadly select the follow- ing datasets as our initial instances pool: HH-RLHF (Bai et al., 2022a), ShareGPT (ShareGPT, 2023), Synthetic Instruct GPT-J Pairwise (Dahoas, 2023), Stanford SHP (Ethayarajh et al., 2022), and OpenOrca (Lian et al., 2023). We employ the Alpaca-7b model Taori et al. (2023) as the rollout model for generating responses Ë Y , and gpt-3.5-turbo to revise and obtain Ë Y . The prompt used for revision can be found in Appendix A.2 As for the filtering process, we utilize OpenAssistant/reward-model-deberta-v3-large-v2 (OpenAssistant, 2023) as the reward model. According to the reward score distribution, we empirically set the threshold values Î·1 = 1, Î·2 = 3, Î·3 = 3.5, respectively. The statistics of reward scores and edit operations for the SPA dataset are presented in Table 1, while the distribution of the reward scores is illustrated in Figure 2. We can find that the initial response Ë Y has a large distribution gap with the reference distribution Y , which may cause the model hard to learn from the golden target. In contrast, our revised response is closer to the original distribution but with higher quality, making the rollout model easier to learn. The final SPA dataset we obtained consists of 17,333 instances. Model Details (1) For SFT, we set learning rate to 1e-5 and batch size to 128.'),\n",

To assess the model performance, a typ- ical approach is to construct evaluation bench- marks for measuring the ability level of LLMs in different aspects. Despite that a number of high-quality benchmarks have been released, the concerns about the appropriate use of these benchmarks and the fair comparison of differ- ent models are increasingly growing. Consid- ering these concerns, in this paper, we discuss the potential risk and impact of inappropriately using evaluation benchmarks and misleadingly interpreting the evaluation results. Specially, we focus on a special issue that would lead to inappropriate evaluation, i.e., benchmark leak- age, referring that the data related to evaluation sets is occasionally used for model training. This phenomenon now becomes more common since pre-training data is often prepared ahead of model test. We conduct extensive experi- ments to study the effect of benchmark lever- age, and find that it can dramatically boost the evaluation results, which would finally lead to an unreliable assessment of model performance. To improve the use of existing evaluation bench- marks, we finally present several guidelines for both LLM developers and benchmark maintain- ers. We hope this work can draw attention to appropriate training and evaluation of LLMs. # Introduction Goodhartâ s Law: â When a measure be- comes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.â'),\n",

To better understand how LLMs evolve in model capacity, it becomes essential to construct reliable evaluation benchmarks to test the ability level of LLMs in various tasks, e.g., knowledge reasoning and math problem solving. Recently, a surge of high-quality evaluation benchmarks (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2023) have been proposed to provide a comprehen- sive capability evaluation of LLMs. Typical bench- marks include MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) (for measuring multitask language understanding abil- ity), Big-Bench (Srivastava et al., 2022) (for quan- tifying and extrapolating the capabilities of LLMs), and AGIEval (Zhong et al., 2023) (for evaluating the abilities of tackling human-level tasks). These benchmarks have made great efforts in creating or collecting test resources for evaluating the per- formance of LLMs. Based on these benchmarks, one can conveniently examine the effect of new training strategies or monitor the training status of LLMs (either pre-training or supervised fine- tuning). It has become common to report the results on these evaluation benchmarks for demonstrating the effectiveness of newly released LLMs (Ope- nAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023b; Anil et al., 2023).

Despite the wide use of these benchmarks and leaderboards, increasing concerns (Aiyappa et al., 2023; Li, 2023) are growing about the fairness and reliability in evaluating existing LLMs. A major issue is that the data contamination or leakage is likely to occur for large-scale benchmark evalu- ation, which means that LLMs are trained with relevant or exactly the same data for test. Such an issue could be unconsciously triggered, since we might be unaware of the future evaluation datasets when preparing the pre-training corpus. For exam- ple, GPT-3 has found that Childrenâ s Book Test dataset (Hill et al., 2016) was included in the pre- training corpus, and LLaMA-2 has mentioned that the contexts in BoolQ dataset (Clark et al., 2019) are extracted verbatim from the webpages, which may be included in the publicly available corpus. Indeed, when conducting evaluation with exist- ing benchmarks, the results of evaluated LLMs are mostly obtained by running them on local servers or via API calls. During this process, there is no strict checking on any potentially inappropriate ways (e.g., data contamination) that would cause an un- normal improvement of evaluation performance. To make matters worse, the detailed composition (e.g., data sources) of the training corpus is often regarded as the core â'),\n",

Specifically, we mainly focus on discussing the potential effect of benchmark leakage, which refers to the case that test data or relevant data (e.g., training set) has been included in the pre-training corpus. It would cause an unfair performance ad- vantage when comparing different LLMs or assess- ing the ability level of some specific LLMs. As we discussed before, this issue tends to become in- creasingly more common as we try to collect more public text data for training.

The experimental results reveal that benchmark leakage can lead to an unfair boost in the evalua- tion performance of LLMs. Smaller LLMs (e.g., a 1.3B model) can be deliberately elevated to outper- form 10Ã larger models on certain tasks. As a side effect, the performance of these specially trained LLMs on other normally tested tasks would likely be adversely affected if we fine-tune or train the model only with these leaked data.

It would violate regular eval- uation settings for assessing zero/few-shot gener- alization capability, thus affecting the capability assessment of LLMs. To better understand the potential influence of the benchmark leakage is- sue, we conduct an empirical study that continually trains small-sized LLMs on three settings with dif- ferent levels of information leakage. # 2.1 Experimental Setup Training Settings with Benchmark Leakage Our empirical study aims to test the influence of possible benchmark leakage issues on the evalua- tion results of LLMs. A benchmark typically con- tains a set of test examples, and relies on fixed templates to prompt LLMs for evaluation. Such an evaluation process may lead to three types of benchmark leakage risks, that is, including (1) test prompt, (2) test set, or (3) other relevant data (e.g., training set) into the pre-training corpus. Consider- ing the above settings, we simulate three extreme leakage issues where the three types of information have been used for continually training LLMs, and design the following evaluation settings.

We have the following observations. evaluation into an in-domain test task, making it easier for LLMs to achieve higher results. An in- triguing finding occurs when we examine the result on the Chinese benchmark C3-Dialog. Despite the pre-training corpus of the four LLMs containing very little Chinese data, using training sets doubles their evaluation scores, e.g., elevating GPT-Neo- 1.3Bâ s score from 24.18 to 48.62. This observation underscores the significance of avoiding training set leakage in pre-training, as it can lead to spuri- ous performance improvements that distort the real assessment of model capabilities. First, we can see that using MMLU training set can greatly boost the evaluation results on the MMLU benchmark. However, this improvement comes at the cost of decreased performance on tasks unrelated to MMLU, (such as HellaSwag and GSM8k about commonsense and mathemati- cal knowledge, respectively), suggesting that over- emphasizing a specific task may lower the model generalization capability. Besides, when incorpo- rating all the training sets of the evaluated bench- marks, there is a notable performance increase across almost all the evaluated tasks. Incorporating training data converts the original zero/few-shot Second, the evaluation scores continue to rise as the data leakage becomes more severe.

In this part, we con- duct empirical experiments to examine the side effect on the model performance of other tasks. Experimental Setup To validate the effect, we select three tasks that are not involved in the leaked training data, consisting of two text generation tasks, i.e., LAMBADA (Paperno et al., 2016) and XSum (Narayan et al., 2018), and a code synthe- sis task HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) to evaluate LLMs in the zero-shot setting. LAMBADA is a lan- guage modeling task that tests the ability of LLMs to predict the last word based on the context, and we report the accuracy in predicting words. XSum, on the other hand, is a text summarization task that requires LLM to summarize the key information from long documents. For this task, we report the ROUGE-L metric, which measures the quality of the generated summaries by comparing them with the ground-truth summaries. For HumanEval, we adopt pass@10 as the evaluation metric. Results Analysis We show the results of LLMs with and without benchmark leakage on the three evaluation tasks in Table 3. First, we can observe that after training on the leaked data, the perfor- mance of all LLMs degrades on the two text gener- ation datasets. Specifically, for OpenLLaMA-3B and LLaMA-2-7B, their text summarization abil- ities seem to be weakened after training on the leaked data, resulting in Rouge-L scores of 0.19 and 0.25 in XSum, respectively. Besides, by com- paring the performance on HumanEval, we also see that data leakage primarily leads to performance degradation of LLMs in the code synthesis task. This demonstrates that benchmark leakage may have a negative impact on the performance of these normally tested tasks (without data leverage). # 3.2 Effect on Model Adaptation After training on the leaked data, LLMs are trained to be specially fit for the benchmark data.'),\n",

Experimental Setup To investigate the influence of data leakage on LLMsâ adaptation capability, we select two representative instruction datasets, i.e., Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) and CodeAlpaca (Chaud- hary, 2023). Both of these datasets are synthetic and generated using the Self-Instruct method. For comparison, Alpaca primarily contains natural lan- guage instructions, whereas CodeAlpaca focuses on code generation instructions. We use these datasets to fine-tune the LLMs with or without training on the leaked data, and subsequently evalu- ate their performance on the previously mentioned text generation and code synthesis tasks. Results Analysis In Table 4, by comparing the performance of the instruction-tuned LLMs (+Al- paca or +CodeAlpaca) with and without training on the leaked data, we can see that the models with benchmark leakage still underperform their non- leaked counterparts.

However, since our main purpose is to reveal that benchmark leverage might cause severe side effects on LLMs in addition to spurious performance im- provement, we omit these experiments due to the compute limit. # 4 Discussion In light of the potential risks of benchmark leakage, it is necessary to revisit the existing evaluation set- tings for LLMs and investigate possible strategies to avoid such data contamination issues. # 4.1 Fairness in Evaluating Zero/Few-shot Generalization Ability Based on our empirical findings in previous sec- tions, the evaluation results of LLMs in specific benchmarks can be dramatically boosted when the related or same data of the test tasks is acciden- tally used for training. In the literature of machine learning, zero/few-shot learning often refers that the samples at test time were not observed during training for a learner (Wang et al., 2021; Xian et al., 2019). It is evident that benchmark leverage does not comply with this requirement, making it un- fair to compare different LLMs when such a case exists. Furthermore, data leverage can also bring an unfair advantage in the few-shot setting since the learner can observe more task-relevant data at training time. the original zero- shot/few-shot generalization task would degenerate into much easier in-domain evaluation tasks, and it would intensify the phenomenon of benchmark hacking, i.e., a benchmark is no longer useful for evaluation due to the high performance of the in- volved comparison methods. However, in practice, it is challenging to fully eliminate the leakage risk from model train- ing (Golchin and Surdeanu, 2023; Shi et al., 2023). It is because an evaluation benchmark is often con- ducted based on some public text sources, e.g., web- pages and scientific papers.'),\n",

We found that data leakage can largely boost the benchmark re- sults of LLMs (even small models), making the evaluation unfair and untrustworthy. These find- ings suggest that such attempts should be strictly avoided for fairly assessing the model performance on evaluation benchmarks. Despite that this issue is hard to be fully elimi- nated from the pre-training stage, we suggest sev- eral useful guidelines to improve the use of exist- ing evaluation benchmarks. A key point is that both LLM developers and benchmark maintain- ers should be aware of the data contamination is- sue when interpreting and using the results from the performance leaderboards. In practice, several heuristic strategies can be useful to detect such po- tential contamination issues, e.g., calculating the token overlap between training and evaluation data. Besides, we also suggest benchmark test should be conducted with multiple task prompts for deriving a more stable and reliable model performance. This work aims to draw the attention of the re- search community to the appropriate use of existing evaluation benchmarks for LLMs. More meaning- ful work can be conducted following this line, e.g., alerting the potential contamination datasets. # Limitation In this work, we conducted preliminary experi- ments to emphasize the potential risks associated with benchmark leakage in training LLMs. How- ever, there are still several limitations in our study.

Nonetheless, we strongly recommend avoiding this situation as it would breaks the nature of zero-shot/few-shot evaluation. Second, we did not explore more fine-grained data leakage scenarios in this study, such as only leaking training examples without labels and vary- ing the proportion of the leaked dataset. We en- courage more research efforts into this issue with more systematic studies. Third, we did not calculate the degree of con- tamination between the mainstream benchmarks and commonly-used pre-training datasets, which could serve as an important reference for alerting LLM developers to adjust their evaluation settings.

These models have been showcasing their reasoning abilities and achieving high performance in various problem-solving tasks, including professional exams such as the bar exam (Bommarito II and Katz, 2022), a math test (Zhang et al., 2023), and medical diagnoses (Nori et al., 2023). Among many recent findings related to LLMs, one interesting point is the introduction of â Chain-of-Thought (CoT)â prompting (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022). This method elicits reasoning before generating outputs. Nevertheless, this recent method has primarily experimented with logical or arithmetic tasks. Whether reasoning about emotional states or underlying causes enhances empathetic responses to user input remains a relatively under-explored area and merits investigation. Empathetic requires cognitive reasoning of othersâ mental states. Different psychotherapeutic approaches offer varied perspectives on empathy (Hofmann et al., 2010; Linehan, 1987; Cooper and McLeod, 2011; Wubbolding et al., 2017). By integrating these approaches into LLMsâ reasoning stage, we can enhance the depth and specificity of their empathetic responses. For this purpose, this study delves into these possibilities and proposes a novel prompting, Chain-of- Empathy prompting (CoE). The CoE prompt integrates a text generation.'),\n",

Related Work # 2.1. Theoretical Backgrounds of Empathy Empathy, defined as sharing othersâ emotions and experiences, is a multifaceted concept encompassing cognitive and emotional aspects (Neff, 2003; Anderson and Keltner, 2002; De Vignemont and Singer, 2006; Hall and Schwartz, 2019; Zaki, 2019). Cognitive empathy involves understanding othersâ emotions and perspectives, linked to abilities such as mentalizing and narrative imagination (Eisenberg, 2014). It requires an in-depth cognitive appraisal of the situation, considering factors like pleasantness, control, and certainty of the outcome (Lazarus, 1991; Wondra and (emotional) 2015). Affective Ellsworth, empathy allows to experience individuals othersâ emotions, while motivational empathy, a newer concept, embodies the desire to alleviate othersâ emotional distress (Zaki, 2019).'),\n",

Empathetic Communication in Text Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been increasingly developing conversational agents, or chatbots, across various professional domains. These include mental healthcare for victims of crime (Ahn et al., 2020), individuals on the autism spectrum (Diehl et al., 2012), and those suffering from anxiety disorders (Rasouli et al., 2022). Recently, chatbots designed for psychotherapy (e.g., CBT) have shown promising results in assisting the long-term treatment of anxiety and depression (Nwosu et al., 2022). However, current AI-generated responses appear generic and less authentic, making personalized responses a significant challenge.

Computational Approach to Empathy Past research in psychotherapy has primarily focused on empathy based on the analysis of nonverbal cues, such as body language and facial expressions, often requiring manual coding of empathetic responses (Scherer et al., 2001; American Psychiatric Association et al., 1994; Ekman and Friesen, 1971). Recent advances in artificial intelligence have shifted towards a computational approach, where empathy is predicted from a text corpus and quantified through the labeling of emotions (Rashkin et al., 2019) and distress (Buechel et al., 2018). While most studies have traditionally concentrated on the clientâ s capacity for the empathy, counselor is increasingly recognized as critical to successful therapy outcomes (Truax and Carkhuff, 2007). This aspect of expressed empathy is particularly relevant to our approach, where we aim to use LLMs to reflect their understanding of the clientâ s needs accurately. # 2.4.'),\n",

Conclusions In summary, we developed a CoE reasoning prompt for generating empathetic responses based on psychotherapy models, and we the performance of empathetic compared strategy classification. Our findings revealed that LLMs without reasoning showed a significant preference for the exploration strategy, with interpretation being the least preferred strategy. Although all reasoning prompts generated responses most strongly associated with exploration, they differed from the base prompt by generating interpretation to a certain extent. Intriguingly, only the CBT- CoE generated the highest number of the interpretation strategy. This pattern might reflect CBTâ s inherent approach - clarifying cognitive errors to clients. These findings incorporating importance of highlight context-specific therapeutic interactions with generative AIs. # 8. Limitations and Suggestions We acknowledge several limitations that should be considered research and development. First, we did not employ more extensive evaluative criteria for empathy, especially those validated from psychology literature like the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (Davis, 1980; Davis, 1983). Future studies should consider evaluating LLMs using their these established scales communication and reproducibility. Our evaluation focused solely on the empathic accuracy of the LLMsâ and did not measure user perception. User perception of empathetic expression varies depending on whether interact with humans or artificially intelligent systems (Medeiros et al., 2021). Furthermore, people perceive and react differently to AIsâ empathetic expressions (Urakami et al., 2019). Thus, future works should investigate how users perceive and respond to the modelsâ empathetic responses to enhance our understanding of the efficacy of LLMsâ empathetic expressions. For quantitative evaluation, we used a single LLM model (GPT-3.5) and one domain, mental health. Incorporating a diverse text corpus, and motivational interviewing (Miller and Rollnick, 2012), could enable LLMs to produce more personalized communication. This presents an opportunity for future research to encompass a wider array of topics and conversational styles, thereby increasing the reliability of LLMâ'),\n",

The typical ap- proach involves making comparisons between pairs or lists of documents. Although effective, these listwise and pairwise methods are not efficient and also heavily rely on intricate prompt engineering. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel instruction distillation method. The key idea is to distill the pairwise ranking ability of open-sourced LLMs to a simpler but more efficient pointwise ranking. Specifically, given the same LLM, we first rank documents using the effective pairwise approach with complex instructions, and then distill the teacher predictions to the pointwise ap- proach with simpler instructions. Evaluation results on the BEIR, TREC, and ReDial datasets demonstrate that instruction distillation can improve efficiency by 10 to 100Ã and also enhance the ranking performance of LLMs. Furthermore, our approach surpasses the performance of exist- ing supervised methods like monoT5 and is on par with the state-of-the- art zero-shot methods. The code to reproduce our results is available at www.github.com/sunnweiwei/RankGPT. # Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have achieved remarkable success in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks (OpenAI, 2022; 2023).

Relevance ranking has been the most critical problem in IR, which aims at ranking a set of candidate items by their relevance given the query (Fan et al., 2021). Recently, there has been a series of works using large models as zero-shot rankers through pointwise, pairwise, and listwise ranking prompting, and these have achieved impressive results on IR benchmarks (Sun et al., 2023c; Ma et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023). Employing LLMs for ranking tasks still faces several practical challenges, including appli- cation efficiency and output stability. On one hand, both listwise and pairwise ranking methods suffer from efficiency issues. For listwise ranking (Sun et al., 2023c; Ma et al., 2023), the exponential time complexity of the Transformer with respect to input length renders it impractical for many industrial applications. Pairwise ranking requires pairing every document with every other, with the obvious drawback being its costly O(n2) calls to LLMs (Qin et al., 2023). On the other hand, while pointwise ranking is more efficient, it compromises on effectiveness (Liang et al., 2022). The pretraining objective of LLMs isnâ t inherently tailored for ranking tasks (i.e., generative language modeling vs. relevance ranking), meaning its prediction probability isnâ t calibrated to the relevance score (Zhao'),\n",

All methods are based on the T5 series foundation models. RG refers to the relevance generation method, and PRP refers to the pairwise ranking method. et al., 2021; 2023). Other challenges, such as unstable outputs, position bias, and repetitions from LLMs, become more pronounced in IR tasks, where deterministic output in terms of relevance is crucial (Sun et al., 2023c). To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Instruction Distillation method to enhance the efficiency and stability of LLMs in the ranking task. The key idea is to distill the predictions of pairwise ranking (PRP) with computationally demanding instruction (teacher instruction) to the efficient pointwise prompting method but with simpler instruction (student instruction). Through this distillation process, the task instructions used for ranking are substantially simplified, leading not only to increased efficiency but also to enhanced performance. In this work, we use open-sourced LLMs FLAN-T5 and our method is zero- shot text ranking since FLAN-T5 is not directly exposed to human-labeled data. We empirically evaluate instruction distilled models against other baselines in Figure 1. These distilled student models are between 10 and 100Ã more efficient compared to their teacher models (i.e., PRP) while also yielding significant enhancements. Compared to vanilla pointwise ranking methods (Relevance Generation methods, RG), our distilled models show a 40% performance improvement in terms of nDCG@10. Remarkably, our distilled FLAN- T5-XL model even surpasses the SOTA supervised systems like monoT5-3B (Nogueira et al., 2020) in IR benchmarks. This is particularly notable as it achieves this without relying on any human relevance judgments. We also condu Further verification is conducted on various ranking tasks such as the BEIR benchmark and the conversational recommendation tasks present in the REDIAL benchmark.

Recently, LLMs have found increasing applications in information retrieval (Zhu et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023a; Hou et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023b; Bao et al., 2023). These methods can be broadly divided into two categories: synthetic data generation and relevance ranking. Several approaches have been proposed to utilize LLMs to generate synthetic data for IR. For example, SGPT (Muennighoff, 2022) generates text embeddings using GPT for dense retrieval; and Gao et al. (2022); Wang et al. (2023a) proposes to generate pseudo-documents using LLMs and retrieve these pseudo-documents first using queries. Dai et al. (2023) proposes to generate pseudo-queries for few-shot dense retrieval. In addition, LLMs have also been used for relevance ranking tasks. UPR (Sachan et al., 2022a) and SGPT-CE (Muennighoff, 2022) introduce instructional query generation methods, which rank documents based on the generation likelihood of query given the document. HELM (Liang et al., 2022) utilizes instructional relevance generation for ranking, prompting LLMs to generate relevance proxy tokens and rank documents based on the generation probability. RankGPT (Sun et al., 2023c) proposes a zero-shot permutation generation method, which prompts LLMs to directly generation the ranking permutation and its performance surpasses supervised models when based on GPT4. Qin et al. (2023) proposes a pairwise ranking prompting method (PRP) based on open-sourced LLMs.'),\n",

It would be hard for computationally costly methods to be applied to a practical scenario. 2.2 LLMs Distillation Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs such as GPT-4 often come with high costs and lack open-source availability. As a result, considerable research has explored various ways to distill the capabilities of LLMs into specialized, customized models. For instance, Fu et al. (2023) and Magister et al. (2022) have successfully distilled the reasoning ability of LLMs into smaller models. Self-instruct (Wang et al., 2023b; Taori et al., 2023) propose iterative approaches to distill GPT-3 using their outputs. Additionally, Sachan et al. (2022b) and Shi et al. (2023) utilize the generation probability of LLMs to improve retrieval systems. Snell et al. (2022) introduces a similar context distillation method to simplify the overlong context when prompting LLMs on Text-to-SQL tasks. This paper presents the Instruction Distillation method, aiming at distilling the ability explored by sophisticated instructions into the model using more efficient instructions to enhance the model efficiency and output stability. # 3 Method In this section, we introduce the instruction distillation method in detail. This novel ap- proach enhances both the effectiveness and efficiency of open-sourced LLMs during the inference stage by distilling the capabilities harnessed by complex instructions into a more efficient one. Thus, when deploying to real-world applications, our methodology is able to obtain good performance which necessitates only lower computation costs compared to others.'),\n",

Here, ri â {1, 2, . . . , n} denotes the rank of candidate di. For instance, if ri = 3, it denotes that di is ranked third among the n candidates.

Diverse prompting strategies have been explored. Based on the type of instruction employed, existing strategies can be categorized into three types: (1) pointwise ranking, (2) pairwise ranking, and (3) listwise ranking (Wu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023). Pointwise Ranking assigns an independent score to each item di, subsequently ranking the set D based on these scores. A prevalent pointwise prompting approach for LLMs is instructional relevance generation, which is exemplified in HELM (Liang et al., 2022). In this approach, LLMs are prompted to output either \"Yes\" or \"No\" to determine the relevance of the candidates to a given query. The generation probability is then converted to the relevance score: _ _ f1+f(Yes | Irc(q,di)), if output Yes (2) \\' =f(No | Zrc(q,d;)), if output No Here f (Â·) represents the large language model, and IRG denotes the relevance generation instruction that converts the input q and di into the test-based prompt. si = 1 |q| â t log p(qt | q<t, pi, Iquery) (3) Pairwise Ranking is employed by PRP (Qin et al., 2023). In this technique, both the query and a pair of candidate items serve as prompts, guiding the LLMs in ranking tasks. For every pair of items di and dj, a specific pairwise comparison instruction, denoted by IPRP, is employed to instruct the LLMs, i.e., f (Â·), to determine which item is more relevant to the given query. This can be formalized as: ci,j = 1, 0, 0.5, if f (IPRP(q, di, dj)) = i if f (IPRP(q, di, dj)) = j else (4) Here, ci,j denotes the LLMâ s choice.'),\n",

Listwise Ranking has been adopted by Sun et al. (2023c); Ma et al. (2023). This approach involves feeding a set of items into the LLMs, where each item is identified by a unique identifier (e.g., [1], [2], etc.). The LLMs are then instructed to generate a permutation of these items, such as â [2] > [3] > [1] > . . . â : Perm = f (IList(q, d1, d2, . . . , dn)) (6) 4 Table 1: Computational complexity of different instruction methods. n is the number of items to be ranked. k is a constant related to the sliding window method.

To ensure consistency in notation with scoring-based methodologies, the relevance score si is defined as the reciprocal of its rank: si := 1 ri 3.3 Computational Complexity of Different Instructions. Different ranking instructions offer various trade-offs in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. A summary of these instructions is listed in Table 1. Among these, the pointwise ranking is computationally the most efficient, having a complexity of O(N). Nevertheless, this approach requires the model to yield a calibrated pointwise score, a feat which is notably challenging. In contrast, the pairwise ranking paradigm resolves the calibration issue by engaging in one-to-one pairwise comparisons. This solution, however, elevates the computational complexity to O(N2). To tackle this, Qin et al. (2023) propose two methods to curtail the pairwise rankingâ s complexity: sorting and the sliding window technique. While promising, these methods are still in their nascent stages, proving challenging to stabilize and parallelize. On another note, listwise ranking demonstrates good performance when tested on commer- cial and also proprietary LLMs, such as GPT-4.'),\n",

Our BM25 implementation is derived from BM25Okapi as presented in RankBM25 (Trotman et al., 2014). Prior to retrieval, we ensure that stopwords are eliminated. In implementing the pairwise prompting strategy, each queryâ s 10 passages are juxtaposed in pairs, leading to the generation of 90 ordered passage pairs. The teacher models are instructed to determine which document is more relevant to the query and subsequently produce the ranking results. The results are then used as the pseudo labels for pointwise instruction distillation. To harness the full potential of the ranking outcomes, we employ RankNet (Burges et al., 2005). Conversational Recommendation Task. For this task, we use the dialogue history as the query, the descriptions of movies as documents, and employ BM25 to fetch the top-5 movies into the candidate pool. Furthermore, following Hou et al. (2023), an additional 4 popular movies are incorporated into the candidate pool3. This is done to simulate the inherent feature of popularity bias in recommendations (Chen et al., 2023).'),\n",

Based on these results, we draw the following observations: Firstly, when compared with previous unsupervised LLM prompting strategies, our instruction-distilled modelsâ inference speed aligns with that of the Relevance Generation method, and it is notably over 100Ã faster than the PRP method. Moreover, the performance of our approach using FLAN-T5-XL and FLAN-T5-Large surpasses both the Relevance Generation and PRP methods with the same LLMs. Secondly, the instruction-distilled models yield results akin to their supervised counter- parts but with reduced annotation requirements. Specifically, our instruction-distilled FLAN-T5-XL model achieves nDCG@10 of 71.92 and 69.29 on TREC-DL19 and TREC-DL20, respectively, either matches or surpasses the performance of the supervised monoT5 of equivalent parameter size. Lastly, the instruction-distilled models always perform superior to their teachers. For example, the distilled models of all different model sizes perform better than their PRP teachers. This can be attributed to the fact that unspecialized teacher models might produce unstable outputs. After distillation on task-related data, student models are able to strictly'),\n",

As evidenced by our results labeled â Ours (XL)â in Figure 3 â which captures the process of distilling the predictions from FLAN-T5-XL to smaller models â it becomes clear that instruction distillation from larger models invariably boosts the capabilities of smaller ones.

However, the semantic gap between natural language and recommendation tasks is still not well addressed, leading to multiple issues such as spuriously-correlated user/item descriptors, ineffective language modeling on user/item contents, and ineffi- cient recommendations via auto-regression, etc. In this paper, we propose CLLM4Rec, the first generative RS that tightly integrates the LLM paradigm and ID paradigm of RS, aiming to address the above challenges simultaneously. We first extend the vocabulary of pretrained LLMs with user/item ID tokens to faithfully model the user/item collaborative and content semantics. Accordingly, in the pretraining stage, a novel soft+hard prompting strategy is proposed to effectively learn user/item collaborative/content token embeddings via language modeling on RS-specific corpora estab- lished from user-item interactions and user/item features, where each document is split into a prompt consisting of heterogeneous soft (user/item) tokens and hard (vocab) tokens and a main text con- sisting of homogeneous item tokens or vocab tokens that facilitates stable and effective language modeling. In addition, a novel mutual regularization strategy is introduced to encourage the CLLM4Rec to capture recommendation-oriented information from user/item contents. Finally, we propose a novel recommendation-oriented finetuning strategy for CLLM4Rec, where an item prediction head with multinomial likelihood is added to the pretrained CLLM4Rec backbone to predict hold-out items based on the soft+hard prompts established from masked user-item interaction history, where rec- ommendations of multiple items can be generated efficiently1.'),\n",

Consequently, it is promising to develop the next generation of RS based on the pretrained LLMs [16], fully utilizing their encoded knowledge, logical reasoning abil- ity, and generative AI power to understand and reason with the user/item semantics and make more accurate recommendations accordingly, especially when users and items are associated with large amounts of textual features, such as biographies, descriptions, content, reviews, and explanations, etc., in modern online platforms [17, 18]. (see Fig. 1 for an intuitive example of an LLM-based RS) # 1 INTRODUCTION With content growing exponentially on the Web, recommender system (RS) has become an essential component for online service platforms [1]. Nevertheless, since Netflix released its Prize in 2006 [2], RS has long been dominated by the ID-based paradigm, where users and items are represented by unique, continuous ID embed- dings denoting their semantic similarity (e.g., w.r.t. usersâ prefer- ences on items, user/item contents, etc.) [3]. Exemplar ID-based RSs include matrix factorization-based methods such as PMF [4] and the two-tower models [5], where the user/item ID embeddings are either randomly initialized and learned from their historical interactions (i.e., collaborative filtering [6]), or established based on user/item content features (i.e., content-based methods [7, 8]). Recently, large language model (LLM) has become a heated re- search topic that revolutionized both academia and industry [9].

The above procedure can be performed in a zero-shot manner [23â 26], where the recommendation decisions are obtained directly from the pretrained LLM (e.g., we input all relevant information regarding a user and an item into the chatbox of ChatGPT and ask if the user will interact with the item), or if groundtruths are available, the pretrained LLMs can also be finetuned, such that RS-specific knowledge can be updated into the pretrained model [20, 27â 29]. Although progress has been achieved by these pioneer works, some fundamental dichotomies between natural language process- ing (NLP) and recommendation still remain to be addressed.

One strategy is pseudo-ID-based method, where an ID-like word (e.g., \"user_ð \" or \"item_ð \") is used to rep- resent the ð th user and ð th item [20]. However, since the vocabu- lary of most LLM contains number-tokens up to two digits, when tokenized, the pseudo ID breaks down into atomic tokens, e.g., \"user_4332\" into [\"user\", \"_\", \"43\", \"32\"], where spurious correlations can be introduced for irrelevant users/items (e.g., \"user_4332\" with \"user_43\" and \"user_32\"). In contrast, description-based methods use semantically meaningful descriptions to index users/items, such as item titles [19, 24] or a small amount of newly-introduced tokens assigned to different user/items based on their content similarity [30]. However, description-based methods introduce a strong induc- tive bias on user-item semantic similarity, which may not faithfully capture the true semantics. Introducing user/item ID tokens, un- fortunately, is generally considered infeasible for LLMs, as directly conducting language modeling on sequences with heterogeneous tokens can be ineffective and unstable, especially when the vocabu- lary of most LLMs is diluted (e.g., â'),\n",

Even if user/item ID token embeddings can be effectively learned via language modeling, another challenge that hinders effective collaborative filtering with LLMs is that, since the order of inter- actions usually does not matter for direct recommendations while human language naturally has an order, spurious temporal cor- relation can be introduced for items placed in different positions when transforming the user historical interactions into textual sen- tences. Furthermore, for content modeling, since pretrained LLMs are not recommendation-oriented, they can easily capture noise in the user/item textual features irrelevant to the recommendation purpose. Finally, since LLMs generate the next token in an autore- gressive manner, recommending multiple items can be inefficient. For both pseudo-ID-based and description-based indexing strate- gies, item candidates usually need to be explicitly provided in the prompt. These issues severely hinder their industrial applications where the candidate pool is large and low latency matters. To address the above challenges, we present CLLM4Rec, the first method that tightly combines the ID paradigm of RS with the LLM-based paradigm to address the semantic gap. We first extend the vocabulary of pretrained LLMs with user/item ID tokens to faith- fully model the user/item collaborative/content semantics, where the embeddings are learned in two stages. The pretraining stage consists of mutually-regularized collaborative and content LLMs that learn user/item token embeddings via language modeling on RS-specific corpora established from user/item interactions and tex- tual features. Specifically, a novel \"soft+hard\" prompting strategy is proposed for effective language modeling on documents with heterogeneous tokens, where each document is decomposed into a prompt consisting of user/item (soft [31]) and vocab (hard) tokens that describe the contexts and a main text consisting of homoge- neous item tokens (i.e., interaction history) or vocab tokens (i.e., user/item textual features), respectively. Through this strategy, the prediction heads for the two LLMs can focus exclusively on collab- orative and content information, and the stability and effectiveness of language modeling can be substantially enhanced. In addition, a stochastic reordering strategy is proposed for the collaborative LLM to ignore the order of item tokens without negative influence on the vocab tokens.

Based on the part of transformer utilized for language modeling, existing LLMs can be categorized into three classes: encoder-only LLMs, such as BERT [32], encoder-decoder-based LLMs, such as T5 [12], and decoder- only LLMs, such as GPT [11] and LlaMA [13], etc.'),\n",

The training of LLMs is mainly based on two stages. In the pretraining stage, LLMs are trained on large corpora such as website content, Wikipedia, ArXiv paper, and GitHub codes via language modeling (i.e., next/masked token pre- diction), where knowledge in the corpus can be effectively encoded in the weights of the transformer network facilitated by the stacked self-attention modules. Then, during the finetuning stage, exemplar prompt-output pairs (such as questions and answers) or human feedback on multiple generated answers are provided to the LLMs such that they can conduct logical reasoning and generate answers based on the encoded knowledge from the pretrained stage. # 2.2 LLM in Recommender Systems Recently, LLM-based RS has attracted extensive attention from both academia and industry, which are promising to address the long- standing issues of traditional ID-based RSs, such as shallow textual information understanding, poor generalization, etc. [34, 35]. Hou et al. showed that existing LLMs can be viewed as zero-shot rankers, Collaborative Large Language Model for Recommender Systems which can rank the relevance of movies based on user historical in- teractions and movie descriptions. However, since pretrained LLMs are not aligned with the recommendation task, more efforts have been devoted to the finetuning of LLMs to obtain recommendation- oriented models. An exemplar work is P5 [20], which finetunes T5 with token sequences transformed from interactions and user/item features, where items are presented by pseudo-IDs in the form of \"item_ð'),\n",

Afterwards, M6 [19] was proposed that combines text infill- ing and auto-regression in the pretraining stage, where pseudo IDs in P5 are completely avoided and replaced by textual descriptions. Recently, TALLRec [36] was proposed where items are represented by both pseudo-ID and textual descriptions. Pseudo-ID-based item representations can easily introduce spurious correlations between irrelevant items. To address this issue, Hua et al. proposed to intro- duce a small number of new tokens, where tokens used to describe the items are determined by their content and collaborative similar- ity. However, representing items with multiple shared tokens can still introduce bias. In addition, for the above methods, candidate items need to be explicitly provided in the prompt when conducting direct recommendation, where the size of candidate pool is limited. Finally, recommendations are generated via autoregression, which is highly inefficient. In summary, the dichotomy between natural language processing and RS still remains to be well addressed. # 3 METHODOLOGY 3.1 Problem Formulation In this paper, we focus on recommendations with implicit feedback [37].

For each user, we randomly select 80% of interactions for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing, where as least one item is selected in the valida- tion and the test set.

The statistics of the dataset are summarized in Table 3 in Appendix. Implementation Details. Due to the space limitation, we 4.1.2 only discuss CLLM4Rec with GPT-2 backbone with token embed- ding 768 and token size 50,257 in this section, where experiments with T5 backbone are discussed in Appendix B. During the train- ing stage, we first optimize the content LLM as Eq. (5) via lan- guage modeling for 10 epochs to warm up the user/item content token embeddings. Then, in the mutually-regularized pretraining stage, we alternatively train the collaborative and content LLMs as specified in Eqs. (7) and (8) for 100 epochs. Finally, we conduct the recommendation-oriented finetuning for 150 epochs, where the RecLLM is monitored with metrics Recall@20, Recall@40, and Collaborative Large Language Model for Recommender Systems NDCG@100 calculated on the validation set as with [39]. RecLLM with the best performance are logged and evaluated on the test set as the final results. ð ð in Eqs.

(a) Qualitative Analysis. Both pseudo-ID-based and description-based methods discussed in Section 2.2 represent user/item with multiple tokens and formu- late direct recommendation as a token generation problem. Since the generated tokens could be irrelevant to the recommendation purpose, candidate items usually need to be explicitly provided in the prompt (e.g., P5 [20] provides 100 candidate items where one is positive, and TALLRec [36] outputs yes/no decision based on user/item descriptions in the prompts, etc.). In contrast, CLLM4Rec can generate multiple recommendations from the entire candidate pool. Therefore, these methods cannot directly work in our setting, and the comparisons are mainly based on qualitative analysis. (b) Quantitative Analysis In addition, we design the following LLM-based baselines to quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of CLLM4Rec. â ¢ Llm-Scratch has the same structure as CLLM4Rec, but it trains the whole model from scratch instead of loading and fixing the weights of the pretrained LLM backbone.'),\n",

An interesting finding is that, LLM-FTAll, which finetunes the whole model including the pretrained LLM backbone, performs worse than CLLM4Rec, which optimizes only the newly introduced user/item token embeddings.

Therefore, the recommendation performance degenerates to a similar level as the LLM-CF. On the other hand, when ð ð is too large, the MR loss in Eqs. (7), (8) and (10) dominates, which hinders CLLM4Rec from learning user/item token embeddings via language modeling and finetuning. Generally, for all four datasets, the performance of CLLM4Rec peaks at around ð ð = 1, which serves as a good start when applying the GPT-based CLLM4Rec to new datasets. # 5 CONCLUSION In this paper, we proposed CLLM4Rec, the first method that tightly couples the ID paradigm and the LLM paradigm of RS, which faith- fully captures user/item semantics while fully utilizing encoded knowledge and logical reasoning ability of pretrained LLMs simul- taneously. Specifically, with mutually-regularized pretraining based on soft+hard prompting strategy, CLLM4Rec can effectively capture the user/item collaborative and content information via language modeling. Furthermore, with recommendation-oriented finetuning, the pretrained knowledge of CLLM4Rec can be fully utilized to efficiently generate recommendations. Extensive experiments show the multi-faceted superiority of CLLM4Rec over state-of-the-art.

The experimental results are summa- rized in Table 4. We can find that although CLLM4Rec with T5 back- bone generally outperforms ID-based and shallow LM-based base- lines, its performance is consistently worse than CLLM4Rec with GPT-2 backbone. The overall inferior performance of CLLM4Rec with T5 backbone can be two-fold. First, we note that the vocab embeddings in T5 are initialized with unit variance, whereas embed- dings in GPT-2 are initialized with a variance of 0.02. Therefore, the weights and embeddings in T5 has much larger numerical values, which leads to large update steps when errors are backpropagating from the outputs to the prompts. Therefore, the training is not as stable as the GPT-2 backbone.'),\n",

However, the proliferation of these models has also been accompanied by a growing trend towards commercialization and a lack of transparency, a phenomenon that is increasingly influencing the dynamics of the open-source community. Historically, the open-source community has thrived on the principles of collaboration, trans- parency, and unrestricted sharing of ideas. However, as the commercial potential of LLMs has been recognized, this openness has begun to diminish. The reality is that many organi- zations only make model checkpoints publicly accessible, while withholding vital information on model reproduction. This practice signifi- cantly hampers the progress of the field.

We identified a small subset of SkyPile, encompassing exercises and solu- tions that span a broad spectrum of subjects from primary to graduate school.

Given the majority of these exercises are STEM-related, we hence- forth refer to this subset and its complement as SkyPile-STEM and SkyPile-Main, respectively. Rather than training the Skywork-13B foun- dation model directly on SkyPile as a whole, we adopted a two-stage training approach. The first stage, which constitutes the primary pre- involves training the model training phase, from scratch on SkyPile-Main. In the sec- ond stage, our Skywork-13B is enriched with STEM-related domain knowledge and problem- solving skills through continual pre-training on SkyPile-STEM. To circumvent the potential issue of catastrophic forgetting, this continual pre-training is performed on a mix of SkyPile- STEM and SkyPile-Main, rather than exclu- sively on SkyPile-STEM. The decision to segregate Stage-1 and Stage- 2 pre-training serves a dual purpose. Firstly, we acknowledge that a significant proportion of the samples from SkyPile-STEM are, by their nature, supervised data. Those data are closely related to popular benchmarks such as CEVAL (Huang et al., 2023), MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), and can be utilized in a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process to directly enhance model performance on related downstream tasks. In this context, the separation between Stage-1 and Stage-2 training enables us to more effectively assess the impacts of general-purpose pre-training (on web texts) and targeted pre-training (on in- domain/supervised data). Such insights could inform future data collection and compilation strategies for foundational model training. Secondly, by restricting first stage pre- training to general-purpose data, we are able to produce a version of foundation model as an alternative to the one with targeted enhance- ment. While the latter demonstrates superior performance on certain downstream tasks, it is less capable in language modeling of natural texts. We posit that this alternative is a valu- able contribution to the community, given its potential to excel in applications that do not require STEM-related competencies. 2.2 Training Progress Monitoring It is of vital importance to monitor and assess progress made during pre-training in real-time.'),\n",

The main issue of monitoring training loss lies in that its effectiveness comes into question when considering the potential of overfitting. The training loss is equivalent to validation loss only if the training data is utilized exactly once (i.e., in one epoch). Yet, in practical scenarios of training LLMs, high-quality data often go through the training process multi- ple times (Taylor et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a; RoziÃ¨re et al., 2023; Gunasekar et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b). Besides, even after ex- plicit de-duplication, there may still exist signif- icant amount of duplicated data in the training set (Soboleva et al., 2023; Abbas et al., 2023). In either cases, solely relying on training loss can lead to overlooking the issue of overfitting, thereby producing overly optimistic estimates of model performance. The top left subplot in Figure 3 illustrates the trajectory of the pre-training loss for our Skywork-13B model. Consistent with findings reported in (Touvron et al., 2023a,b; Baichuan Inc., 2023), the loss demonstrates a steady decline throughout the training process. However, an observation not disclosed in these cited works is the behavior of the validation loss on held-out sets. From the figure it can be clearly seen that the validation losses seem to level off as training approaches its final stages. Benchmarking based on intermediate check- points is another common monitoring approach (Touvron et al., 2023a; Baichuan Inc., 2023). Nevertheless, it presents several challenges. Firstly, there is a high variance in benchmark results, which can lead to unstable and unreli- able assessments of training progress. Secondly, benchmark results are not sensitive to minor progress in training. This insensitivity makes it difficult to accurately track gradual improve- ments during the training process. Besides, weaker models do not follow instructions well. Hence benchmark results may not accurately reflect their true learning progress or poten- tial. Finally, an inconvenience posed by most benchmarks is the necessity for model genera- tion. This process is notably resource-intensive, demanding substantial computational power.'),\n",

More specifically, we have created separate validation sets for code, academic pub- lications, social media posts, web texts in Chi- nese and English, among others. Conventional monitoring metrics are also utilized, but they serve merely as supplementary tools. In Figure 1 we plot the curve of language model vali- dation loss on English web texts against the average metric of several English downstream tasks. It is apparent that there is a very high correlation between the two quantities, showing that validation loss can serve as a valid proxy metric for downstream task performance.

It allows for comparison not only between different checkpoints produced within a single train- ing session, but also across varied models from the community. This ensures a consis- tent and equitable basis for model compari- son. Note that monitoring the validation loss on a held-out set sharing the same distribution as the training set is a ubiquitous practice in machine learning. However, the observation of validation loss across multiple held-out sets, each with deliberate, unique distributions, is not common. We also note that the perspective asserting the primacy of language modeling loss as the paramount performance metric for models is not a recent revelation. This principle has been either explicitly or implicitly adopted in a number of research studies, as exemplified in (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Anil et al., 2023; Xia et al., 2023; DelÃ©tang et al., 2023). # 3 Pre-training 3.1 SkyPile Corpus In order to train Skywork-13B, we build SkyP- ile, a vast, high quality corpus comprising more than 6 trillion tokens. A segment of the corpus, comprising over 150 billion tokens of web text, has been open sourced to facilitate research and training on Chinese LLMs3. Our SkyPile is an amalgamation of several sources, the overwhelming majority of which is gleaned from publicly accessible channels. Numerous prior research works, exemplified by initiatives such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a) and RefinedWeb (Penedo et al., 2023), have substantiated the notion that publicly ac- cessible web data can yield exceptionally high- quality LLMs. In alignment with this empirical evidence, we subscribe to the premise of leverag- ing publicly accessible webpages as our primary source for training data. 3huggingface.co/datasets/Skywork/ SkyPile-150B'),\n",

Our data processing pipeline, inspired by (Wen- zek et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a; Penedo et al., 2023), incorporates the following stages: â ¢ Structural Extraction: Due to the pre- dominant source of our dataset being pub- licly accessible web pages, the objective of the first stage is the extraction of pertinent content while concurrently expunging extra- neous textual elements that are deemed non- contributory to the training of our language model, e.g. these superfluous components in- clude navigational bars, site-specific contact information, disjunctive title texts devoid of substantive content, etc. Subsequent to this culling process, the retained informa- tion predominantly consists of contiguous, medium to long-form textual passages. In the pursuit of cultivating a profoundly adept LLM, the modelâ s exposure must encompass a diverse array of content spanning an extensive spec- trum of domains. Prior endeavors within the field have entailed the task of assigning cat- egorical labels to each individual document or webpage, thereby manually dictating the composition of the training corpus. How- ever, we posit that the corpus employed for LLM training has burgeoned to such an ex- tent that the knowledge it encapsulates can not be compartmentalized discretely. Conse- quently, eschewing a label-centric approach, our methodology centers on benchmarking the semantic affinities existing between tex- tual segments, thereby identifying and omit- ting those text blocks characterized by an exceedingly high recurrence rate. Deduplication has demonstrated its remarkable efficacy in en- hancing the overall quality of a training cor- pus, and it has found extensive application in virtually all prominent datasets (Hernan- dez et al., 2022; Kandpal et al., 2022; Abbas et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2022). Within the framework of SkyPile, we regard deduplica- tion as an integral component of the Distri- bution Filtering process. When considering the broader perspective, it becomes evident that duplication constitutes a paramount factor influencing the semantic distribution of a corpus.'),\n",

In this phase, we deploy the CCNet (Wenzek et al., 2020) pipeline to perform two critical filtration tasks: the elimination of content of inferior quality and the exclusion of pages that are neither in English nor Chinese. We trained a binary classifier that predicts the likelihood that a given webpage is suitable for inclu- sion as a reference within the Wikipedia cor- pus. The outcome of this stage is organized into distinct quality-based categories, and we retain exclusively the high quality groups, opting to discard the remaining groups in its entirety. Quality Filtering: Above we described our pre-processing pipeline for natural text. As for Github content, we em- ploy an approach that is similar to (Together Computer, 2023). We have devised a collection of straightforward yet efficacious heuristics, en- compassing criteria such as line length filtration and alphanumeric thresholds, designed to dis- cern and exclude content of low quality. Our cri- teria are specifically oriented toward enhancing content quality, as opposed to merely curbing its volume. Notably, in contrast to prevailing practices that involve the wholesale removal of a significant portion of json, xml, yaml, and html content, we have made a deliberate choice to retain a judiciously proportionate represen- tation of these data formats. Note that in pursuit of harmonizing the modelâ s proficiency in both English and Chi- nese, we include in SkyPile a curated high- quality parallel corpora. This data is meticu- lously structured to pair a complete English paragraph with its corresponding Chinese coun- terpart, ensuring a seamless alignment of lin- guistic capabilities between the two languages. 3.2 Training Data Composition Our Skywork-13B is pre-trained for 3.2 trillion tokens, sampled from SkyPile.

Since our model is intended to be English-Chinese bilin- gual, we extend the original vocabulary of LLaMA, which primarily consists of latin-based words and subwords, with frequently used Chi- nese characters and words. Specifically, we add 8000 single-character tokens from BERTâ s vocabulary (Devlin et al., 2019) to LLaMAâ s vocabulary. We further expand the vocabu- lary with 25k frequent Chinese multi-character words. This results in a total vocabulary size of 65,536 tokens, of which 17 are reserved as # special symbols. As in LLaMA, we split all numbers into indi- vidual digits, and fall back to bytes to decom- pose unknown UTF-8 characters.

Our pre- liminary experiments, as illustrated in Figure 2, validate these changes, demonstrating the improved performance they confer. Details on this experiment can be found in Appendix A. While our network architecture takes after the LLaMA model to a great extent, there ex- ists a notable difference in our preference for a deeper, yet narrower, network.

These include Tensor Model Paral- lelism (Shoeybi et al., 2020), Sequence Paral- lelism (Korthikanti et al., 2022), ZeRO-Stage2 (Rajbhandari et al., 2020), and Checkpointing (Chen et al., 2016).

ZeRO-1 substantially diminishes the GPU memory footprint of the Adam optimizer state without increasing the burden on intercommu- nication. Pipeline Parallelism offers memory optimization at a minimal communication over- head, which decreases as the gradient accumu- lation step increases, thereby mitigating the slowdown of all-reduce as DP Size increases. Regarding operator optimization, we adopted Flash Attention V2 (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023), a strategy that both optimizes GPU memory and expedites the training process. Upon extensive preliminary experiments, we have decided to adopt the combination of DP256, PP2, and ZeRO-1 as our distributed training strategy for Skywork-13B.

Our initial plan was to train Skywork-13B for two trillion tokens.

In Figure. 3, we report in red curves the evolution of language mod- eling losses and several benchmark results of our Skywork-13B during this session. It is evi- dent that by the end of this session, the model had not reached saturation. We hypothesized that the model could further benefit from ad- ditional pre-training, prompting us to launch a secondary training session targeting an addi- tional one trillion tokens. The second training session utilized a slightly different composition of training data compared to the initial 0 â ¼ 2T session, as data from certain sources had been depleted and fresh sources were introduced. Owing to the shift in the training distribution, we meticulously tuned the learning rate parameter, eventually deciding on a constant learning rate of 6e-5 for the 2 â ¼ 3T session.

These multi-step problems require be- tween 2 and 8 steps to solve. GSM8K is usually used in benchmarking multi-step mathematical reasoning ability of LLMs. In Table 5 we present a comparison of perfor- mance results from different models on these benchmarks. The metrics for CEVAL, CMMLU and MMLU are 5-shot accuracy, while for GSM8K it is 8-shot accuracy. Higher num- bers indicate better performance. It can be seen that our Skywork-13B achieves the high- est score on both the CEVAL and MMLU and GSM8K benchmarks, with scores of 60.6 and 62.1 and 55.8 respectively. On the CMMLU benchmark, Baichuan2-13B achieves the high- est performance with a score of 62.0. In summary, our Skywork model has demon- strated exceptional performance across a di- verse range of comprehensive benchmark tests. Results of individual subjects of the CEVAL can be found in Table 12. Results of other benchmarks can be found in Appendix C. # 4.3 Language Modeling Results # 4.3.1 LM as a solution to benchmark overfitting Conventional benchmarks for evaluating LLMs often rely on static datasets of human- annotated examples. A core issue with this approach is that updating the test samples reg- ularly is difficult and costly. Over time, the static test sets tend to be overfitted, producing misleading benchmark results. We propose language modeling evaluations as a compelling alternative. Perplexity in lan- guage modeling acts as a proxy metric strongly linked to performance on diverse downstream tasks (see Figure 1). Since language modeling solely requires unlabeled natural text, it elimi- nates the need for expensive human annotation. Constructing and revising language modeling test sets is low-cost, as new data can be readily sampled from newly published content. Ad- ditionally, if a test set becomes compromised, fresh test data can quickly be sampled as a replacement. # 4.3.2 Construction of diverse LM testsets We compare the language modeling capabilities of various language models with our Skywork- 13B, focusing on Chinese language.'),\n",

In the era preceding the advent of LLMs such as GPT-4 (Bubeck et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023) and Claude (Bai et al., 2022), supervised data for NLP tasks was generally scarce. This was because the process of data collection and an- notation was both time-consuming and costly. Due to the scarcity of supervised data, NLP researchers rely on unsupervised pre-training techniques (Mikolov et al., 2013; Peters et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019) to improve downstream task performance via transfer learning, where supervised data is to be used only in the fine-tuning stage. In this context, pre-training on in-domain (supervised) data was pointless, as it would defeat the pur- pose of pre-training itself (transfer learning).'),\n",

This new reality blurs the boundary between pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, making it feasible to incorporate substantial amounts of supervised data into the pre-training phase (Gunasekar et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b).

Data contamination has two consequences. The first one is that the performance of an LLM when evaluated on a benchmark it already processed dur- ing pre-training will be overestimated, causing it to be preferred with respect to other LLMs. This affects the comparative assessment of the quality of LLMs. The second is that papers proposing sci- entific hypotheses on certain NLP tasks could be using contaminated LLMs, and thus make wrong claims about their hypotheses, and invalidate alter- native hypotheses that could be true. This second consequence has an enormous negative impact on our field and is our main focus.'),\n",

The experimental protocols involve strict control over the data, espe- cially test data, which needs to be totally unseen during development, but also over training and de- velopment data. This is essential to assess the per- formance of a model in zero-shot, few-shot, or fully supervised settings. Since fine-tuning and prompt- ing of Large Language Models (LLMs) became commonplace (Min et al., 2021) it has been increas- ingly difficult to enforce those strict protocols. Pre- training LLMs is expensive, and therefore, most of the time, researchers use LLMs trained by third- party entities (Raffel et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a), which are agnostic to the target tasks where those LLMs are going to be used.

(2023) presents preventative strategies to avoid con- tamination in the future. In this position paper, we propose a complemen- tary line of action which seeks to measure and doc- ument data contamination cases, specifying LLM, benchmark and evidence supporting contamination.

The paper starts by introducing background, fol- lowed by a definition of data contamination, con- tamination at different steps, methods to measure data contamination and a call for action. # 2 Background Detection of contamination cases has been tradi- tionally done by directly analyzing the training data (Dodge et al., 2021), but the current scale of the pre-training data makes it difficult (Kreutzer et al., 2022; Birhane et al., 2021). Without proper doc- umentation and search tools like ROOTS (Piktus et al., 2023) it is very difficult for any researcher to actually know whether their datasets are compro- mised on a given model. More recently, this task became even harder, as the best-performing LLMs are deployed as products, and therefore, their train- ing corpora are kept secret. In this case, it has been shown that the high memorization abilities of LLMs can be used to generate portions of the train- ing texts (Carlini et al., 2021; Magar and Schwartz, 2022). Using this memorization property, Sainz et al. (2023) show that ChatGPT generates portions of popular NLP benchmarks. Furthermore, LLMs memorization has been studied on data-leakage scenarios (Elangovan et al., 2021). Regarding data contamination cases, Dodge et al. (2021) exposed that the C4 corpus (Raf- fel et al., 2020), a corpus used to pre-train sev- eral LLMs such as T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), con- tained the test splits of several benchmarks that were crawled from GitHub. Moreover, Brown et al. (2020) acknowledged a bug in their filter- ing script that caused the contamination of several benchmarks during the GPT-3 training. Further- more, OpenAI (2023) stated that parts of the BIG- bench (Srivastava et al., 2023) benchmark were inadvertently mixed into the training set, enough to stop them from evaluating the model on it.'),\n",

There- fore, the performance results reported for GSM-8K cannot be taken as zero-shot results when compared to other models. Recently, Sainz et al. (2023) reported that several benchmarks have already been com- including the popular promised in ChatGPT, CoNLL2003 (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003). There are several preprints that evaluate ChatGPT on CoNLL03 (Wei et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a; Han et al., 2023) and at least one confer- ence paper published on ACL 2023 that evaluates GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Codex (Chen et al., 2021) on the same benchmark (Li et al., 2023b). Appendix A shows evidence for data contamination for those LLMs, and casts doubts on the conclu- sions of those papers. # 3 Defining data contamination In general, data contamination refers to any breach in the strict control of datasets required by the ex- perimental protocol. In this paper, we focus on the specific case where a LLM has processed the eval- uation benchmark during its pre-training. However, different types of contamination exist and each of them has different implications. In this section, we present three types of contamination: guideline, text and annotation. Guideline contamination happens when the an- notation guidelines for a specific dataset are seen by the model. Usually, for specialized annotations, highly detailed guidelines are required. The guide- lines can usually be publicly found on the internet, even for datasets that are not public or require buy- ing a license for their use, ACE05 (Walker et al., 2006) for example. The more details the guide- lines have the more information and examples they provide. A model aware of the guidelines for a spe- cific task or dataset has advantages over a model without such information. We should consider the guideline contamination, especially on zero and few-shot evaluations.'),\n",

Some examples of this type of contami- nation are the datasets based on Wikipedia texts. Wikipedia is commonly used as a source of pre- training data, but, it is also a frequent source of text to create new datasets. MultiCoNER 2 (Fetahu et al., 2023), a Named Entity Recognition dataset based on Wikipedia links and Wikidata informa- tion, is an example of this phenomenon. Models that have already seen Wikipedia in its original form (including the markup annotations) have more information to better identify a part of the annota- tions (the entity boundaries) of the dataset. As pointed out by Dodge et al. (2021), other datasets built from the web such as IMDB (Maas et al., 2011) and CNN/DailyMail (Hermann et al., 2015) can be also compromised. This kind of contamina- tion should be taken into account when developing automatically annotated datasets. Annotation contamination happens when the annotations (labels) of the target benchmark are exposed to the model during training. Depending on the splits of the benchmark that have been ex- posed, we can have the following cases: (1) When the evaluation split is involved, the experiment is completely invalidated. This is the most harmful level of contamination. (2) When the train or de- velopment splits are involved, this would not affect comparisons with other models that have been de- veloped using those same splits, but it does inval- idate conclusions claiming zero-shot or few-shot performance. # 4 Contamination on different steps Currently, the standard procedure to train and de- ploy language models has three main steps: pre- training a language model, fine-tuning the model to follow instructions and/or align with human feed- back; and an iterative improvement step after de- ployment. Data contamination does not only occur in the pre-training step of LLMs, but can occur later in the training pipeline. # 4.1 Contamination during pre-training During the pre-training, there is a high chance that undesired data is fed to the model.'),\n",

Avoiding data contam- ination completely is not realistic, as it is impos- sible to know every dataset that the research com- munity can test an LLM on. However, allowing the researchers to access and perform queries on the pre-training data may ensure that no corrupted evaluations are performed. In fact, keeping the pre-training data not available for LLM consumers may derive undesired influences on downstream tasks (Li et al., 2020; Gehman et al., 2020; Groen- wold et al., 2020). In addition, researchers building LLMs should avoid, at least, contamination from well-known standard benchmarks such as GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) or SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2020). As Dodge et al. (2021) showed, see their Table 2, various standard benchmarks were found in the C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) corpus. # 4.2 Contamination on supervised fine-tuning The supervised fine-tuning or instruction-tuning step is another step where contamination can oc- cur. Nevertheless, it is much less frequent as it is a required practice in the research community to document the training data in order to publish your findings. As an example of those, we can find the FLAN dataset collection (Longpre et al., 2023), OPT-IML Bench (Iyer et al., 2023), Super- Natural Instructions (Wang et al., 2022b), the P3 collection (Bach et al., 2022) and so on. Recently, more and more machine-generated text is being used to fine-tune language models. Some examples of these are Self-Instruct (Wang et al., 2022a), Unnatural Instructions (Honovich et al., 2022), Alpaca Data (Taori et al., 2023) and ShareGPT (Chiang et al., 2023). The aim of those datasets is usually to make public and smaller white-box models imitate black-box mod- els such as ChatGPT (Gu et al., 2023).'),\n",

More alarm- ing, is the case that popular crowd-sourcing meth- ods like MTurk have started using LLMs to gener- ate data that was supposed to be manually gener- ated (Veselovsky et al., 2023). # 4.3 Contamination after deployment The last step where the models can be exposed to contamination is applied mostly on LLMs as ser- vice products. With the recent improvements in the quality of LLMs, the models that were supposed to be part of bigger products become products by themselves (ChatGPT or Bard for example). It is worth noting that, although they are closed models, i.e. no information is known about the architec- ture or training details, the research community has evaluated them on standard benchmarks (Jiao et al. (2023); among others). The monetary success of closed systems is closely tied to the performance of the model. Therefore, companies have a strong incentive to audit user inputs and retrain their sys- tem when the performance in a task is determined to be poor. Those models that are actually being ac- cessed via API calls have been iteratively improved with user input, leading to evaluation data exposure. As a result, the models became aware of the testing data, at the point that you can easily recreate the dataset as we discuss in Section 5.2 (see examples in Appendix A). # 5 Measuring data contamination For the reasons we already mentioned, it is nec- essary to measure the existent data contamination cases and to document relevant contamination ev- idence. In order to achieve this goal, we differen- tiate two cases. In the first case, we would have open models where there is public access to all the training data, including text used in pre-training, but also, if the LLM was trained on them, instruc- tion tuning datasets and deployment datasets. In the second case, we would have closed models for which there is no access to training data. # 5.1 Open LLMs Most of the research on data contamination has been focused on analyzing pre-training data with string-matching operations (Dodge et al., 2021), as this provides direct evidence that the LLM was contaminated.'),\n",

Therefore, several tools for data auditing have been released recently: The ROOTS Search Tool (Piktus et al., 2023) and Data Por- traits (Marone and Durme, 2023) among others. As an example of their usefulness, Piktus et al. (2023) found that BLOOM (Workshop et al., 2023) should not be evaluated on XNLI (Conneau et al., 2018) due to contamination. These tools should be made available for all open LLMs, in order to allow for contamination case discovery. In addition, there is no currently agreed-upon methodology to measure the level of contamina- tion. For cases where the full benchmark is not found, we propose to measure the level of data con- tamination using benchmark data overlap, that is, the percentage of the benchmark that can be found in the pre-training dataset (Dodge et al., 2021; Pik- tus et al., 2023).'),\n",

Although this scenario is much more challenging than the former, we foresee that it will become the most prevalent. Developing methods to measure the data contamination in this scenario must be crucial for future evaluations. To tackle this problem, we propose to take advantage of LLMâ s memorization capabilities. Appendix A shows some examples of using memorization to uncover data contamination for the CONLL2003 benchmark on three LLMs. In cases where the LLM does not produce the benchmark verbatim, it is left to the auditor to examine the output and judge whether the evidence supports contamination.'),\n",

Alternatively, automatic metrics for measuring data contamination levels could be developed. As an initial step in this direction, we reuse and adapt the extractability definition presented in Carlini et al. (2023) for defining memorization. We define that an example s is extractable from evaluation dataset d and model m if there exists a sequence of k examples x immediately preceding s in d data such that s is generated when prompting model m with x. We can define the degree of contamination of model m for dataset d as the ratio of extractable examples with respect to the total number of exam- ples in the dataset. One further question remains to be solved which is whether the lack of memorization of a bench- mark ensures that the LLM was not trained on that benchmark. One hypothesis could be that the lack of memorization is correlated with the performance, even if the LLM was trained on the benchmark. Thus the LLM would not have any advantage with respect to another LLM that was not trained on the benchmark. This is currently speculation, so further research on this topic is necessary, given the extended use of closed LLMs in NLP research.'),\n",

Given the incredible scale of this data, up to trillions of tokens, it is all but certain that it includes potentially problematic text such as copyrighted materials, personally identifiable information, and test data for widely reported reference benchmarks. However, we currently have no way to know which data of these types is included or in what proportions. In this paper, we study the pretraining data detection problem: given a piece of text and black-box access to an LLM without knowing the pretraining data, can we determine if the model was trained on the provided text? To facilitate this study, we introduce a dynamic benchmark WIKIMIA that uses data created before and after model training to support gold truth detection. We also introduce a new detection method MIN-K% PROB based on a simple hypothesis: an unseen example is likely to contain a few outlier words with low probabilities under the LLM, while a seen example is less likely to have words with such low probabilities. MIN-K% PROB can be applied without any knowledge about the pretraining corpus or any additional training, departing from previous detection methods that require training a reference model on data that is similar to the pretraining data. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate that MIN-K% PROB achieves a 7.4% improvement on WIKIMIA over these previous methods. We apply MIN-K% PROB to three real-world scenarios, copyrighted book detection, contaminated downstream example detection and privacy auditing of machine unlearning, and find it a consistently effective solution. # INTRODUCTION'),\n",

This lack of transparency poses critical challenges to scien- tific model evaluation and ethical deployment. Critical private information may be exposed during pretraining; previous work showed that LLMs generated excerpts from copyrighted books (Chang et al., 2023) and personal emails (Mozes et al., 2023), potentially infringing upon the legal rights of original content creators and violating their privacy. Additionally, Sainz et al. (2023); Magar & Schwartz (2022); Narayanan (2023) showed that the pretraining corpus may inadvertently include benchmark evaluation data, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness of these models. In this paper, we study the pretraining data detection problem: given a piece of text and black-box access to an LLM with no knowledge of its pretraining data, can we determine if the model was pretrained on the text? We present a benchmark, WIKIMIA, and an approach, MIN-K% PROB, for pretraining data detection. This problem is an instance of Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which was initially proposed by Shokri et al. (2016). Recent work has studied fine-tuning data detection (Song & Shmatikov, 2019; Shejwalkar et al., 2021; Mahloujifar et al., 2021) as an MIA problem. However, adopting these methods to detect the pertaining data of contemporary large LLMs presents two unique technical challenges: First, unlike fine-tuning which usually runs for multiple epochs, pretraining uses a much larger dataset but exposes each instance only once, significantly'),\n",

If the average log likelihood is high, the text is likely in the pretraining data. reducing the potential memorization required for successful MIAs (Leino & Fredrikson, 2020; Kandpal et al., 2022). Besides, previous methods often rely on one or more reference models (Carlini et al., 2022; Watson et al., 2022) trained in the same manner as the target model (e.g., on the shadow data sampled from the same underlying pretraining data distribution) to achieve precise detection. This is not possible for large language models, as the training distribution is usually not available and training would be too expensive. Our first step towards addressing these challenges is to establish a reliable benchmark. We introduce WIKIMIA, a dynamic benchmark designed to periodically and automatically evaluate detection methods on any newly released pretrained LLMs. By leveraging the Wikipedia data timestamp and the model release date, we select old Wikipedia event data as our member data (i.e, seen data during pretraining) and recent Wikipedia event data (e.g., after 2023) as our non-member data (unseen). Our datasets thus exhibit three desirable properties: (1) Accurate: events that occur after LLM pretraining are guaranteed not to be present in the pretraining data.'),\n",

(2) General: our benchmark is not confined to any specific model and can be applied to various models pretrained using Wikipedia (e.g., OPT, LLaMA, GPT-Neo) since Wikipedia is a commonly used pretraining data source. (3) Dynamic: we will continually update our benchmark by gathering newer non-member data (i.e., more recent events) from Wikipedia since our data construction pipeline is fully automated. MIA methods for finetuning (Carlini et al., 2022; Watson et al., 2022) usually calibrate the target model probabilities of an example using a shadow reference model that is trained on a similar data distribution. However, these approaches are impractical for pretraining data detection due to the black-box nature of pretraining data and its high computational cost. Therefore, we propose a reference-free MIA method MIN-K% PROB. Our method is based on a simple hypothesis: an unseen example tends to contain a few outlier words with low probabilities, whereas a seen example is less likely to contain words with such low probabilities. MIN-K% PROB computes the average probabilities of outlier tokens. MIN-K% PROB can be applied without any knowledge about the pretrainig corpus or any additional training, departing from existing MIA methods, which rely on shadow reference models (Mattern et al., 2023; Carlini et al., 2021). Our experiments demonstrate that MIN-K% PROB outperforms the existing strongest baseline by 7.4% in AUC score on WIKIMIA. Further analysis suggests that the detection performance correlates positively with the model size and detecting text length. To verify the applicability of our proposed method in real-world settings, we perform three case studies: copyrighted book detection (Â§5), privacy auditing of LLMs (Â§7) and dataset contamination detection (Â§6). We find that MIN-K% PROB significantly outperforms baseline methods in both scenarios. From our experiments on copyrighted book detection, we see strong evidence that GPT-3 1 is pretrained on copyrighted books from the Books3 dataset (Gao et al., 2020; Min et al., 2023).

Furthermore, our controlled study on dataset contamination detection sheds light on the impact of pretraining design choices on detection difficulty; we find detection becomes harder when training data sizes increase, and occurrence frequency of the detecting example and learning rates decreases. # 2 PRETRAININING DATA DETECTION PROBLEM We study pretraining data detection, the problem of detecting whether a piece of text is part of the training data. First, we formally define the problem and describe its unique challenges that are not present in prior finetuning data detection studies (Â§2.1). We then curate WIKIMIA, the first benchmark for evaluating methods of pretraining data detection (Â§2.2). 2.1 PROBLEM DEFINITION AND CHALLENGES We follow the standard definition of the membership inference attack (MIA) by Shokri et al. (2016); Mattern et al. (2023). Given a language model fÎ¸ and its associated pretraining data D = {zi}iâ [n] sampled from an underlying distribution D, the task objective is to learn a detector h that can infer the membership of an arbitrary data point x: h(x, fÎ¸) â {0, 1}. We follow the standard setup of MIA, assuming that the detector has access to the LM only as a black box, and can compute token probabilities for any data point x. Challenge 1: Unavailability of the pretraining data distribution. Existing state-of-art MIA methods for data detection during finetuning (Long et al., 2018; Watson et al., 2022; Mireshghallah et al., 2022a) typically use reference models gÎ³ to compute the background difficulty of the data point and to calibrate the output probability of the target language model : h(x, fÎ¸, gÎ³) â {0, 1}. Such reference models usually share the same model architecture as fÎ¸ and are trained on shadow data Dshadow â D (Carlini et al., 2022; Watson et al., 2022), which are sampled from the same underlying distribution D.'),\n",

However, this assumption of accessing the distribution of pretraining training data is not realistic because such information is not always available (e.g., not released by model developers (Touvron et al., 2023b; OpenAI, 2023)). Even if access were possible, pretraining a reference model on it would be extremely computationally expensive given the incredible scale of pretraining data. In summary, the pretraining data detection problem aligns with the MIA definition but includes an assumption that the detector has no access to pretraining data distribution D. Challenge 2: Detection difficulty. Pretraining and finetuning differ significantly in the amount of data and compute used, as well as in optimization setups like training epochs and learning rate schedules. These factors significantly impact detection difficulty. One might intuitively deduce that detection becomes harder when dataset sizes increase, and the training epochs and learning rates decrease. We briefly describe some theoretical evidence that inform these intuitions in the following and show empirical results that support these hypotheses in Â§6. To illustrate, given an example z â D, we denote the model output as fÎ¸(z) Now, take another example y sampled from D \\\\ D (not part of the pretraining data). Determining whether an example x was part of the training set becomes challenging if the outputs fÎ¸(z) and fÎ¸(y) are similar. The degree of similarity between fÎ¸(z) and fÎ¸(y) can be quantified using the total variation distance. According to previous research (Hardt et al., 2016; Bassily et al., 2020), the bound on this total variation distance between fÎ¸(z) and fÎ¸(y) is directly proportional to the occurrence frequency of the example x, learning rates, and the inverse of dataset size, which implies the detection difficulty correlates with these factors as well.'),\n",

Data construction. We collect recent event pages from Wikipedia. Step 1: We set January 1, 2023 as the cutoff date, considering events occurring post-2023 as recent events (non-member data). We used the Wikipedia API to automatically retrieve articles and applied two filtering criteria: (1) the articles must belong to the event category, and (2) the page must be created post 2023. Step 2: For member data, we collected articles created before 2017 because many pretrained models, e.g., LLaMA, GPT-NeoX and OPT, were released after 2017 and incorporate Wikipedia dumps into their pretraining data. Step 3: Additionally, we filtered out Wikipedia pages lacking meaningful text, such as pages titled \"Timeline of ...\" or \"List of ...\". Given the limited number of events post-2023, we ultimately collected 394 recent events as our non-member data, and we randomly selected 394 events from pre-2016 Wikipedia pages as our member data. The data construction pipeline is automated, allowing for the curation of new non-member data for future cutoff dates. Benchmark setting. In practice, LM users may need to detect texts that are paraphrased and edited, as well. Previous studies employing MIA have exclusively focused on detecting examples that exactly match the data used during pretraining. It remains an open question whether MIA methods can be employed to identify paraphrased examples that convey the same meaning as the original. In addition to the verbatim setting (original), we therefore introduce a paraphrase setting we leverage ChatGPT2 to paraphrase the examples and subsequently assess if the MIA metric can effectively identify semantically equivalent examples. Moreover, previous MIA evaluations usually mix different-length data in evaluation and report a single performance metric. However, our results reveal that data length significantly impacts the difficulty of detection. Intuitively, shorter sentences are harder to detect. Consequently, different data length buckets may lead to varying rankings of MIA methods. To investigate this further, we propose a different-length setting: we truncate the Wikipedia event data into different lengthsâ'),\n",

We describe the desirable properties in Appendix B. 3 MIN-K% PROB: A SIMPLE REFERENCE-FREE PRETRAINING DATA DETECTION METHOD We introduce a pretraining data detection method MIN-K% PROB that leverages minimum token probabilities of a text for detection. MIN-K% PROB is based on the hypothesis that a non-member example is more likely to include a few outlier words with high negative log-likelihood (or low probability), while a member example is less likely to include words with high negative log-likelihood. Consider a sequence of tokens in a sentence, denoted as x = x1, x2, ..., xN , the log-likelihood of a token, xi, given its preceding tokens is calculated as log p(xi|x1, ..., xiâ 1). We then select the k% of tokens from x with the minimum token probability to form a set, Min-K%(x), and compute the average log-likelihood of the tokens in this set: 1 MIN-K% PROB(z) = E > log p(w; |r1, ..., Zi-1)- (1) 2jâ ¬Min-K%(Â«) where E is the size of the Min-K%(x) set. We can detect if a piece of text was included in pretraining data simply by thresholding this MIN-K% PROB result. We summarize our method in Algorithm 1 in Appendix B. # 2OpenAI. https://chat.openai.com/chat 4 # 4 EXPERIMENTS We evaluate the performance of MIN-K% PROB and baseline detection methods against LMs such as LLaMA Touvron et al.

These methods only consider sentence-level probability. Specifically, we use the LOSS Attack method (Yeom et al., 2018a), which predicts the membership of an example based on the loss of the target model when fed the example as input. In the context of LMs, this loss corresponds to perplexity of the example (PPL). Another method we consider is the neighborhood attack (Mattern et al., 2023), which leverages probability curvature to detect membership (Neighbor). This approach is identical to the DetectGPT (Mitchell et al., 2023) method recently proposed for classifying machine-generated vs. human-written text. Finally, we compare with membership inference methods proposed in (Carlini et al., 2021), including comparing the example perplexity to zlib compression entropy (Zlib), to the lowercased example perplexity (Lowercase) and to example perplexity under a smaller model pretrained on the same data (Smaller Ref ). For the smaller reference model setting, we employ LLaMA-7B as the smaller model for LLaMA-65B and LLaMA-30B, GPT-Neo-125M for GPT-NeoX-20B, OPT-350M for OPT-66B and Pythia-70M for Pythia-2.8B.

We performed a small sweep over 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 on a held-out validation set using the LLAMA-60B model and found that k = 20 works best.

This aligns with findings that LMs better memorize tail outliers (Feldman, 2020; Zhang et al., 2021). With more RedPajama tokens in the constructed dataset, downstream examples become more significant outliers. We hypothesize that their enhanced memorization likely enables easier detection with perplexity-based metrics. To verify the our hypothesis, we construct control data where contaminants are not outliers. We sample Real Time Data News August 20234, containing post-2023 news absent from LLaMA pre- training. We create three synthetic corpora by concatenating 1000, 5000 and 10000 examples from this corpus, hence creating corpora of sizes 0.77M, 3.9M and 7.6M tokens respecitvely. In each setting, we consider 100 of these examples to be contaminant (positive) examples and set aside another set of 100 examples from News August 2023 (negative). Figure 5b shows AUC scores decrease as the dataset size increases. Detection of outlier contaminants like downstream examples gets easier as data size increases, since models effectively memorize long-tail samples. However, detecting general in-distribution samples from the pretraining data distribution gets harder with more data, following theoretical expectations. Data occurrence. To study the relationship between detection difficulty and data occurrence, we construct a contaminated pretraining corpus by inserting multiple copies of each downstream data point into a pre-training corpus, where the occurrence of each example follows a Poisson distribution. We measure the relationship between the frequency of the example in the pretraining data and its AUC scores.

In todayâ s landscape of machine learning systems, it is imperative to uphold individualsâ â right to be forgottenâ , a legal obligation outlined in regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Voigt & Von dem Bussche, 2017) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (Legislature, 2018). This requirement allows users to request the removal of their data from trained models. To address this need, the concept of machine unlearning has emerged as a solution for purging data from machine learning models, and various machine unlearning methods have been introduced (Ginart et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Bourtoule et al., 2021; Izzo et al., 2021; Sekhari et al., 2021; Gupta et al., 2021; Ye et al., 2022). Recently, Eldan & Russinovich (2023) introduced a novel approach for performing machine un- learning on LLMs. This approach involves further fine-tuning the LLMs with alternative labels for specific tokens, effectively creating a modified version of the model that no longer contains the to-be-unlearned content. Specifically, the authors demonstrated the efficacy of this method using the LLaMA2-7B-chat model (Touvron et al., 2023b), showcasing its ability to â unlearnâ information from the Harry Potter book series which results in the LLaMA2-7B-WhoIsHarryPotter model5.

The process begins with the identifica- tion of suspicious chunks using our MIN-K% PROB metric. Firstly, we gather the plain text of Harry Potter Series 1 to 4 and segment these books into 512-word chunks, resulting in approxi- mately 1000 chunks. We then compute the MIN-K% PROB scores for these chunks using both the LLaMA2-7B-WhoIsHarryPotter model and the original LLaMA2-7B-chat model. To identify chunks where the unlearning process may have failed at, we compare the MIN-K% PROB scores between the two models. If the ratio of the scores from the two models falls within the range of ( 1 1.15 , 1.15), we classify the chunk as a suspicious unlearn-failed chunk. This screening process identifies 188 such chunks. We also notice that using perplexity alone as the metric fails to identify any such chunk. We then test the LLaMA2-7B-WhoIsHarryPotter model with these suspicious chunks to assess its ability to complete the story. For each suspicious chunk, we prompt the model with its initial 200 words and use multinomial sampling to sample 20 model-generated continuations for each chunk. Results We compare the completed stories with the ground truth storylines using both the SimCSE score (Gao et al., 2021) (which gives a similarity score from 0 to 1) and GPT-4 (where we prompt the model with the template in Table 9 to return a similarity score from 1 to 5, and a reason explaining the similarity). We can still find very similar completion with the original story. For example, 5.3% generated completions have greater and equal to 4 GPT score similarity to the gold completion.

For instance, Table 10 showcases a few such examples, with all of them having SimCSE scores exceeding 0.7. We further note that the study only uses Harry Potter books 1 to 4. Including the whole Harry Potter series (7 books) potentially will expose more unlearn-failed chunks. 7.2.2 QUESTION ANSWERING Selecting Harry Potter-related questions with MIN-K% PROB We generate 1000 questions related to Harry Potter by prompting GPT-4 with the query \"Can you give me a list of questions and 11 answers related to Harry Potter\". Similar to identifying suspocious texts in story completion, we compare the MIN-K% PROB scores between the original and unlearned models and select questions with the ratio falling within the range of ( 1 1.15 , 1.15), resulting in 103 questions. We use the unlearned model to generate answer given these questions, specifically employing multinomial sampling to sample 20 answers for each question. Results We then compare the answers by the unlearned model (referred to as the \"candidate\") to those provided by GPT-4 (referred to as the \"reference\") using the ROUGE-L recall measure (Lin, 2004), which calculates the ratio: (# overlapping words between the candidate and reference) / (# words in the reference). A higher ROUGE-L recall value signifies a greater degree of overlap, which can indicate a higher likelihood of unlearning failure. Among the 103 selected questions, we observe an average ROUGE-L recall of 0.23. Conversely, for the unselected questions, the average ROUGE-L recall is 0.10. These findings underscore the capability of our MIN-K% PROB to identify potentially unsuccessful instances of unlearning. Table 5 shows the selected questions related to Harry Potter that are answered correctly by the unlearned model LLaMA2-7B-WhoIsHarryPotter (with ROUGE-L recall being 1). We also verify the generated answers by cross-checking them against the Harry Potter series. These results suggest the knowledge about Harry Potter is not completely erased from the unlearned model. # 8 RELATED WORK Membership inference attack in NLP.

These attacks pose substantial privacy risks to individuals and often serve as a basis for more severe attacks, such as data reconstruction (Carlini et al., 2021; Gupta et al., 2022; Cummings et al., 2023). Due to its fundamental association with privacy risk, MIA has more recently found applications in quantifying privacy vulnerabilities within machine learning models and in verifying the accurate implementation of privacy-preserving mechanisms (Jayaraman & Evans, 2019; Jagielski et al., 2020; Zanella-BÃ©guelin et al., 2020; Nasr et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022; Nasr et al., 2023; Steinke et al., 2023). Initially applied to tabular and computer vision data, the concept of MIA has recently expanded into the realm of language-oriented tasks. However, this expansion has predominantly centered around finetuning data detection (Song & Shmatikov, 2019; Shejwalkar et al., 2021; Mahloujifar et al., 2021; Jagannatha et al., 2021; Mireshghallah et al., 2022b). Our work focuses on the application of MIA to pretraining data detection, an area that has received limited attention in previous research efforts. Dataset contamination. The dataset contamination issue in LMs has gained attention recently since benchmark evaluation is undermined if evaluation examples are accidentally seen during pre-training. Brown et al. (2020b), Wei et al. (2022), and Du et al. (2022) consider an example contaminated if there is a 13-gram collision between the training data and evaluation example. Chowdhery et al. (2022) further improves this by deeming an example contaminated if 70% of its 8-grams appear in the training data. Touvron et al. (2023b) builds on these methods by extending the framework to tokenized inputs and judging a token to be contaminated if it appears in any token n-gram longer than 10 tokens. However, their methods require access to retraining corpora, which is largely unavailable for recent model releases. Other approaches try to detect contamination without access to pretraining corpora.'),\n",

(2023) simply prompts ChatGPT to generate examples from a dataset by providing the datasetâ s name and split. They found that the models generate verbatim instances from NLP datasets. Golchin & Surdeanu (2023) extends this framework to extract more memorized instances by incorporating partial instance content into the prompt. Similarly, Weller et al. (2023) demonstrates the ability to extract memorized snippets from Wikipedia via prompting. While these methods study contamination in closed-sourced models, they cannot determine contamination on an instance level. Marone & Van Durme (2023) argues that model-developers should release training data membership testing tools accompanying their LLMs to remedy this. However, this is not yet widely practiced.'),\n",

Our approach uses the intuition that trained data tends to contain fewer outlier tokens with very low probabilities compared to other baselines. Additionally, we verify the effectiveness of our approach in real-world setting, we perform two case studiies: detecting dataset contamination and published book detection. For dataset contamination, we observe empirical results aligning with theoretical predictions about how detection difficulty changes with dataset size, example frequency, and learning rate. Most strikingly, our book detection experiments provide strong evidence that GPT-3 models may have been trained on copyrighted books.'),\n",

Our WIKIMIA benchmark demonstrates several desirable properties that make it suitable for evaluating methods to detect data during pretraining on any newly released models. (1) Accurate: Since non-member data consists of events that occurred after the LM pretraining, there is a guarantee that this data was not present during pretraining, ensuring the accuracy of our dataset. We consider Wikipedia event data because of its time sensitivity. A recent non-event Wikipedia page may be only a recent version of an older page that was already present during the modelâ s pretraining, and thus it may not serve as true non-member data. For example, a Wikipedia page created after 2023 about a historical figure or a well-known concept could contain substantial text already mentioned in the pretraining corpus. (2) General: Our benchmark is designed to be widely applicable across different models pretrained on Wikipedia, a commonly used source of pretraining data. This includes models like OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), GPT-Neo (Black et al., 2022), and Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023), thereby ensuring the benchmarkâ s generalizability across various models.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in applying LLMs to zero-shot text ranking, with remarkably impressive results. The earliest zero-shot LLM rankers are pointwise (Liang et al., 2022; Sachan et al., 2022), which score one query and one document at each time and rank the documents based on the scores. Lately, pairwise (Qin et al., 2023) and listwise (Sun et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2023) LLM rankers also show strong performance, but they cannot scale to long lists and still largely rely on a high-quality first-stage ranking. A typical category of pointwise LLM rankers is relevance generation (Liang et al., 2022). In this method, the LLM is prompted to answer whether a document is relevant to the query (or answers the query). Existing pointwise LLM rankers mostly ask the LLM to answer â Yesâ or â Noâ'),\n",

Nevertheless, documents in many datasets are not always entirely relevant or irrelevant to the query. Some documents may not be primarily in- tended to answer the query, but still contain helpful information. There is no accurate mapping between these documents and the binary options. Studies on human subjects show that using binary options sometimes lead to biased an- swers (Rivera-Garrido et al., 2022). Instead, pro- viding reasonably fine-grained options can lead to more reliable results (Roitero et al., 2018; Birkett, 1986; Rivera-Garrido et al., 2022; Johnston et al., 2017). Actually, in information retrieval data sets, the annotation guidelines for human annotators of- ten employ multiple relevance levels, like the 3- level scale used in TREC-COVID (Voorhees et al., 2021) and TREC-Robust (Voorhees, 2005), as well as the 4-level scale used in TREC-DL (Craswell et al., 2020, 2021). We believe that a zero-shot LLM ranker might share the same behavior pattern with human annotators. Therefore, we propose to explicitly provide fine- grained relevance labels in the prompt to zero-shot LLM rankers. Instead of asking the LLM to choose between two options, we provide the LLM with fine-grained relevance labels, such as: â Highly Rel- evantâ , â Somewhat Relevantâ and â Not Relevantâ .'),\n",

It is important to note that our focus is on developing LLM rankers, which is dif- ferent from LLM assessors (Faggioli et al., 2023; Thomas et al., 2023), as our goal is only to derive a high-quality ranking with accurate top-ranked doc- uments instead of estimating the precise (and often discrete) relevance for each individual document to sort ranking systems. We evaluate our prompts for zero-shot LLM ranking on 8 data sets from BEIR (Thakur et al., 2021). The results show that simply adding the in- termediate relevance labels allows LLM rankers to achieve substantially higher ranking performance consistently across different data sets, regardless of whether the actual ground-truth labels of the data set contain multiple graded relevance levels. An in- depth analysis shows that the new prompt enables LLM rankers to distinguish documents that are in- distinguishable when there are only two options provided. We believe this discovery can benefit not only text ranking applications, but other domains such as recommendations (Fan et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023) and user rating prediction (Kang et al., 2023). # 2 Related Work Zero-shot LLM rankers. An emerging thread of research explores how to use general-purpose LLMs for zero-shot text ranking, a shift from tuning-based learning to rank on textual and tradi- tional tabular datasets (Nogueira et al., 2019; Han et al., 2020; Zhuang et al., 2021; Nogueira et al., 2020; Zhuang et al., 2023a; Xian et al., 2022; Liu, 2009; Qin et al., 2021).

The ranking score is typi- cally calculated based on how likely the document is relevant to the query (Liang et al., 2022) or how likely the query can be generated from the doc- ument (Sachan et al., 2022). Our work is most related to this line of research. We will revisit more technical details in Section 3. Pairwise (Qin et al., 2023) and listwise (Sun et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2023; Zhuang et al., 2023b) LLM rankers take multiple documents as input and return the ranking directly. They are usually ap- plied iteratively on smaller sets of documents and often rely on a pointwise first-stage ranker. In this paper, we only focus on pointwise LLM rankers. Zero-shot LLM assessors. Another related re- search area (Faggioli et al., 2023; Thomas et al., 2023) employs LLMs as assessors. The goal of LLM assessors is to provide a relevance label for every query-document pairs, so that the label aligns with the ground-truth relevance label, potentially created by human assessors. Existing studies (Fag- gioli et al., 2023; Thomas et al., 2023) also prompt LLMs with fine-grained relevance labels. LLM assessors are usually used to create an evaluation data set, which can be used to reliably evaluate dif- ferent ranking models. This is different from LLM rankers, which typically only need to ensure that the relative order of the top-ranked documents are accurate. A perfect LLM assessor would also be a perfect LLM ranker, but when LLM capabilities are limited, the priorities of LLM assessor and LLM ranker development diverge. # 3 LLM Rankers In this section, we first revisit existing pointwise LLM rankers. Then we introduce the prompt- ing method of our LLM rankers which score fine- grained relevance labels and how we obtain the final ranking scores. # 3.1 Preliminaries Pointwise rankers.

It can be seen that when the LLM is prompted with only 2 relevance labels (RG-YN, RG-2L), the average performance is lower. However, when the LLM is prompted with more fine-grained relevance labels, the performance can be substantially im- proved. RG-3L on average achieves +2% improve- ment in NDCG@10 compared with RG-2L and RG-YN. RG-S(0, 4) which uses the rating scale 0 to 4 in the prompt also achieves similar im- provement. Note that even on data sets with bi- nary ground-truth labels (e.g., SciFact), using fine- grained relevance labels still achieves substantial improvement. This suggests that the improvement is not merely a result of matching the actual ground- truth relevance levels of the data set.

However, the exact number of fine-grained rel- evance labels needed to achieve the performance improvement varies across different prompts. For example, simply using 3-level textual relevance la- bels is sufficient to achieve average NDCG@10 close to 0.50; but using rating scale from 0 to 2, which also corresponds to 3 relevance levels, can only obtain NDCG@10 lower than 0.48. Figure 2 shows that for rating scale relevance generation RG-S(0, k), the NDCG@10 only gets close to 0.50 with more than about 4 relevance levels. On the other hand, further adding more rele- vance levels does not always improve the perfor- mance. For example, RG-4L performance seems to be on par with RG-3L. In Figure 2, the perfor- mance from RG-S(0, 4) and RG-S(0, 8) also re- main similar, and the performance of RG-S(0, 9) and RG-S(0, 10) is even worse than RG-S(0, 4).

The performance of RG-3L and RG-S(0, 4) are also very close. # 6 Conclusion In this work, we explore the use of more fine- grained relevance labels in the prompt for point- wise zero-shot LLM rankers instead of the binary labels used in existing works. We propose to ei- ther provide intermediate relevance labels such as â Somewhat Relevantâ as additional choices for the LLM or ask the LLM to rate the relevance between query-document pairs using a rating scale. Then we aggregate the likelihood of different relevance levels into ranking scores to obtain the ranked list. Our experiments on BEIR data sets demonstrate that prompting with fine-grained relevance labels can consistently improve the ranking performance across different data sets, as it enables the model to better differentiate query-document pairs poten- tially ranked at the top. We believe our discovery can be further extended to applications beyond information retrieval. For example, the same method can be applied for rec- ommendation (Fan et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023), where the LLM is asked to rate how likely a user would buy an item.'),\n",

For RG- 2L, we replace â Not Relevantâ with â Irrelevantâ ; for RG-3L, we replace â Somewhat Relevantâ with â Partially Relevantâ . The results are shown in Table 4. Regardless of using different textual representations of rele- vance labels, RG-3L consistently outperforms RG- 2L. This suggests that the discovery in this paper is generalizable to different choices of textual rel- evance labels. Another observation is that RG-2L performance varies slightly more than RG-3L per- formance. This might indicate that RG-3L is more robust to different wording of relevance labels.'),\n",

However, the inherent tension between the objectives of helpfulness and harmless- ness presents a significant challenge during LLM training. To address this issue, we propose Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (Safe RLHF), a novel algorithm for human value alignment. Safe RLHF explicitly decouples human preferences regarding helpfulness and harmlessness, effectively avoiding the crowdworkersâ confusion about the tension and allowing us to train separate reward and cost models. We formalize the safety concern of LLMs as an opti- mization task of maximizing the reward function while satisfying specified cost constraints. Leveraging the Lagrangian method to solve this constrained problem, Safe RLHF dynamically adjusts the balance between the two objectives during fine-tuning. Through a three-round fine-tuning using Safe RLHF, we demonstrate a superior ability to mitigate harmful responses while enhancing model perfor- mance compared to existing value-aligned algorithms. Experimentally, we fine- tuned the Alpaca-7B using Safe RLHF and aligned it with collected human pref- erences, significantly improving its helpfulness and harmlessness according to hu- man evaluations.

Con- currently, AI systems that leverage LLMs are increasingly enhancing the efficiency of numerous human activities, such as coding (Chen et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2023), medical assistance (Yang et al., 2022; Moor et al., 2023), education (Kasneci et al., 2023; Kung et al., 2023), law (Katz et al., 2023), and so forth. Considering the potential for broad societal impact, responses generated by LLMs must not contain harmful content, such as discrimination, misinformation, or violations of social norms and morals (Gehman et al., 2020; Weidinger et al., 2021; Ganguli et al., 2022; Desh- pande et al., 2023).

These responses can be labeled as both safe or both unsafe. with Human Feedback (RLHF) (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022) is a practical approach for aligning LLMs with human preferences, both in terms of style and ethical values (Bai et al., 2022a; Ganguli et al., 2022). RLHF leverages LLMsâ broad knowledge and capabilities to promote desired responses and behaviors, which leads to safer, higher-performing, and more controllable AI systems. Both technical reports from GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) and Anthropic (Ganguli et al., 2022) for their LLMs revealed their use of safety-related prompts, constructed through adversarial probing methods like red-teaming, in the RLHF phase to reduce the potential harm of their model. However, the pursuit of increasing helpfulness and harmlessness may often contradict in practice (Ganguli et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a). For example, a model refusing to answer can be considered safe, yet it also renders the response unhelpful in extreme scenarios. Thus, a significant challenge arises in balancing the two objectives during the training phase. Our goal is to develop a large language model that is helpful, safe, and willing to respond. To address the above challenge, we propose a novel framework: Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (Safe RLHF). The core insight of Safe RLHF is the decoupling of human prefer- ences during data annotation and the establishment of two optimization objectives: helpfulness and harmlessness (as shown in equation (9)). Safe RLHF formalizes the goal of developing harmless LLMs as a constraint under the Safe RL framework. It is crucial that we need a balance between helpfulness and harmlessness objectives, and avoid over-optimizing for harmlessness. # The decoupling of preferences and objectives offers two advantages:'),\n",

Compared to the conventional RLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022), Safe RLHF introduces substantial modifications, specif- ically in the stages of Preference Annotation & Modeling and Policy Optimization. 3.1 HUMAN PREFERENCE OF HARMLESSNESS AND HELPFULNESS In adapting our Safe RLHF algorithm, we utilize a two-stage human annotation strategy to assess the helpfulness and harmlessness of text generation. We follow the annotation methodology outlined in Ji et al. (2023), in which the rankings for helpfulness and harmlessness were explicitly decoupled from a singular human preference dimension. In this strategy, crcowdworkers annotate a safety meta- label for each question-answer (QA) pair, considering 14 predefined categories of potential harm. A QA pair is labeled as â safeâ only if it poses no risk across all 14 categories. Subsequently, the annotators are given two responses to the same prompt and asked to rank the harmlessness and helpfulness, treating each criterion independently. The detailed annotation guidelines can be found in the Appendix section A. Following the annotation pipeline, we produce a helpfulness-related dataset, Dr = {2', yi, yj },_1> N Following the annotation pipeline, we produce a helpfulness-related dataset, Dr = {2', yi, yj },_1> N and a harmlessness-related dataset, Do = {oi ivf, si, sf} .

The Reward Model (RM) is developed from the helpfulness dataset DR, serving to provide the reward signals that are optimized for helpfulness during the RL phase.

Assume there exists a virtual response, y0, which lies on the boundary between safe and unsafe clusters, 4 such that CÏ (y0, x) = 0. If y is unsafe, i.e., s(y) = +1, then the Cost Model tends to prefer y. Hence, we aim to maximize the probability of y â » y0|x: p(y â » y0|x) = Ï (CÏ (y, x) â CÏ (y0, x)) = Ï (CÏ (y, x)) = Ï (s(y) Â· CÏ (y, x)) . Similarly, if y is safe, i.e., s(y) = â 1, then the Cost Model tends to prefer y0. Hence, we aim to maximize the probability of y0 â » y|x: p(y0 â » y|x) = Ï (CÏ (y0, x) â CÏ (y, x)) = Ï (â CÏ (y, x)) = Ï (s(y) Â· CÏ (y, x)) . Thus, the second term of the loss function (6) can be viewed as maximizing the likelihood of the BT model regarding the response y0 and y from the dataset DC. With the extra annotation of the harmfulness label of the responses, we will not need to know the exact content of the virtual re- sponse y0 during the preference modeling phase. As shown in Figure 2a, the Cost Model divides the LLMsâ responses into two clusters based on their safety.

The LLM we are training is denoted as Ï Î¸(y|x). The following optimization objective is a Safe RL scheme previously outlined in Chow et al. (2017), hereby defined as the objective for our Safe RLHF setting: maximize Î¸ Exâ ¼D,yâ ¼Ï Î¸(Â·|x) [RÏ (y, x)] , s.t.

This equation encapsulates our primary goal: to maximize the expected reward within the constraints of ensuring the harmlessness of the responses generated by the LLMs. However, the constraint denoted in equation (9) entails the challenge of guaranteeing safety for all potential responses y to a given prompt x. This task is not straightforward using RL methods. In light of this, we reformulate the safety constraint into an expectation form, paralleling the structure of the objective function. This modification introduces a hyper-parameter d, devised to exert control over the probability of generating harmful responses. Our surrogate objective is presented as follows: maximize Î¸ JR(Î¸), s.t.

To address this constrained problem, we leverage the Lagrangian method, a technique for finding the local maxima and minima of a function over a constraint set.

This penalty, which corresponds to the potential harmfulness of the LLMs, can be dynamically modulated via the parameter Î». Specifically, we iteratively solve the min-max problem in equation (12), alternately updating the LLM parameters Î¸ and the Lagrange multiplier Î» (refer to Appendix B.3 to more details).

Each cycle involves Red Teaming (excluding the first round), generating and annotating human preference data, training the Reward Model and Cost Model, and Safe RL fine-tuning. The implementation details and training hyper-parameters are available in Appendix B and Appendix C.1. Initial SFT Model. Our primary experiments begin with the Alpaca-7B model (reproduced). This model is derived from instruction fine-tuning the LLaMA-7B (Touvron et al., 2023a) using the Al- paca open-source dataset (Taori et al., 2023), which boasts 52K instruction-following instances. We selected Alpaca-7B as our initial model for two primary reasons. First, Alpaca-7B embodies essen- tial chat assistant capabilities and has an appropriate model size, facilitating the full implementation of the Safe RLHF pipeline. Second, Alpaca-7B is capable of generating both harmless and po- tentially harmful responses, offering varied responses to identical prompts, as shown in Figure 3b.

Traditional benchmarks often do not capture the full extent to which a model aligns with human values.

Thus, we have developed a unified Reward Model and a unified Cost Model, utilizing training methodologies mentioned in Section 3.2. These models are trained on evenly balanced preference data originating from all iterations of Safe RLHF. With these unified models, we can rapidly evaluate subsequent new models under consistent criteria. The test accuracies for the unified models are detailed in Table 1. Note that we do not employ these unified models to train a single-round Safe RLHF process, as the preference data ac- quisition occurs iteratively. We need intermediate models for the red-teaming procedure, facilitating the collection of new prompts for the follow-up training phases. As illustrated in Figure 4, our SFT model, the Alpaca-7B model (reproduced), has the ability to produce both harmless and harmful responses that are almost evenly separated on each side of the c = 0 dividing line (Figure 4a).

GPT-4 and Human Evaluations. For more accurate assessments, we compare models against each other to generate associated Elo scores, as described in Askell et al. (2021). Specifically, evaluators compare the outputs of two models in response to the same prompt and provide their preferences regarding helpfulness and harmlessness. After obtaining pairwise win-rate relationships between all models, we fit corresponding Elo scores (with an initial score of 1200). According to Chiang & Lee (2023), GPT-4 can replace human evaluators in assessing the alignment capabilities of LLMs. Therefore, we have organized assessments involving both GPT-4 and human evaluators. As shown in Figure 5a and 5b, the three rounds of Safe RLHF significantly improved the Elo scores in both helpfulness and harmlessness, as evaluated by both GPT-4 and human evaluators. When compared to Alpaca-7B, the Beaver-v3 model demonstrated an increase in the Elo score for helpful- ness (GPT-4: +244.91, Human: +363.86) and for harmlessness (GPT-4: +268.31, Human: +237.98).

This effectively aided in making the Safe RLHF training models more harmless. During the third round, since the model was sufficiently safe, Safe RLHF tended to prioritize maintaining the current harmlessness level over excessive optimization. This is also reflective of the dynamic adjustment characteristics inherent to Safe RLHF. Meanwhile, our crowdworkers also labeled whether the modelsâ responses are safe, as shown in Figure 5c. Through three rounds of Safe RLHF training, the Beaver-v3 modelâ s probability of harmful responses on the evaluation set decreased from 53.08% for Alpaca-7B to 2.45%. For the specific prompts used in the GPT-4 evaluation, please refer to Appendix C.2. 4.2.2 THE DECOUPLING OF HARMLESSNESS AND HELPFULNESS In this section, we aim to demonstrate the benefits of explicitly separating harmlessness and helpful- ness in the Safe RLHF pipeline. We use the responses collected from the first round of Safe RLHF to carry out preference labeling and PPO training following the conventional RLHF methodology. During the preference labeling, the difference is that only a comprehensive preference is provided, while other aspects align with Safe RLHF. Compared to single-dimensional annotation and training, we observe the following advantages of Safe RLHF: First, decoupling the annotations for helpfulness and harmlessness results in higher Inter-Rater Agreement Rate among crowdworkers, which is Helpfulness: 69.00% and Safety: 66.53% compared to 61.65%. Second, the agreement between crowdworkers and researchers (i.e. approval rate) is also increased. In single-dimensional annotation, the average approval rate dur- ing a 10% quality inspection drops from at least 90% accuracy to below 80%. Third, as shown in Figure 6a, using the above data for PPO training results in a notable improvement in helpfulness. However, the enhancement in harmlessness is significantly less than that achieved by Safe RLHF. In contrast, Safe RLHF allows a subjective adjustment in the training phase to balance helpfulness and harmlessness.'),\n",

Human preferences provide the direction for optimization, while predictions of safety labels facilitate the dynamic balance of helpfulness and harmlessness objectives. This suc- cessful integration contributes to the success of Safe RLHF. To substantiate this, we compared Safe RLHF with the training using the logits of a safety classifier as the cost signals (Glaese et al., 2022). As illustrated in Figure 6a (CM-classifier), the latterâ s efficiency in improving harmlessness is sig- nificantly inferior to that of Safe RLHF.

This section discusses the related work from the perspective of the three training stages of LLMs. Pre-trained models such as T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) are exposed to a vast corpus of unlabeled text data and trained using unsupervised learning objectives, such as predicting the next word in a sequence. Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) has been explored with models like T0 (Sanh et al., 2021), Flan-T5 (Chung et al., 2022), and Instruct-GPT (Ouyang et al., 2022). These models are fine-tuned from the pre-trained models using task-specific labeled data, a crucial step for models to follow instructions and complete tasks.'),\n",

(2021; 2022) outline six areas of ethical and social risk associated with these models. Rauh et al. (2022) analyze the characteristics of harmful text. Shevlane et al. (2023) discuss extreme risks, including dangerous capabilities and misalign- ments. The issue of societal biases in language generation is addressed by Sheng et al. (2021), while Abid et al. (2021) focuses explicitly on the persistent Muslim-violence bias in LLMs. Deshpande et al. (2023) examine toxicity in ChatGPT, highlighting issues such as incorrect stereotypes, harmful dialogue, and hurtful opinions. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) While LLMs have excelled in vari- ous NLP tasks, they sometimes exhibit unexpected behaviors such as producing inaccurate informa- tion or making biased, misleading, and harmful responses (Bai et al., 2022a;b; KocoÂ´n et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023b). RLHF enables LLMs to progress towards more diverse goals by learning from human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2023; Rafailov et al., 2023; Song et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023). Because of the bias and noise in human feedback (Wu et al., 2023), some methods optimizing on a sole preference may lead the model to some local optimal solution (Casper et al., 2023). Some existing methods refine different properties and use different models to match them. Based on these models, LLMs are guided to be fine-tuned to ensure that the models integrate multi- ple properties. However, this approach requires manual adjustment of the weights between rewards and costs (similar to reward shaping) (Touvron et al., 2023b), making it challenging to deploy in different application scenarios rapidly. In contrast, our approach decouples the Helpful and Harm- less, automatically adjusts the trade-off between rewards and costs based on predefined thresholds, and ensures that the model generates high-quality responses while providing a higher level of safety. This process can be extended to scenarios beyond Helpful and Harmless.'),\n",

Concurrently, the current Safe RLHF model operates within the confines of single-turn conversations. A reformulation to multi-turn conversational con- texts is a potential area to expand upon, to enhance its applicability. Ultimately, our research was conducted using data from Llama-1 (Touvron et al., 2023a) and Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) mod- els which were considering predate Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b).

Our safety alignment paradigm, Safe RLHF, is the first integration of Safe RL and RLHF framework. The core insight of Safe RLHF is the decoupling of human preference during the annotation and a Î»-trade-off to dual helpfulness and harmlessness objectives. In our experiments, we applied three rounds of the Safe RLHF framework to fine-tune the SFT base model. Evaluation results indicate that Safe RLHF effectively enhances the helpfulness and harmlessness of the LLM.

Rrhf: Rank responses to align language models with human feedback without tears. arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.05302, 2023. 15 # A DATA ANNOTATION GUIDELINES A.1 OVERVIEW The paper focuses on generating and annotating a dataset of question-answer (QA) pairs to evalu- ate the performance of LLMs in handling harmful or unsafe prompts. In the two-stage annotation pipeline we have adopted, the first stage involves classifying the safety of each QA pair based on 14 pre-defined harm categories, ranging from hate speech to financial crime. A QA pair is considered harmless if it poses no risk across these categories. The second stage involves ranking the generated responses based on their harmlessness and helpfulness, which provides a comprehensive evaluation framework. The dataset covers a broad spectrum of harm categories, including but not limited to hate speech, violence, and financial crimes, among others. Ethical considerations and safety implications are integral to the annotation process. The harmlessness of a QA pair is gauged by its risk-neutrality across the 14 categories, ensuring alignment with safety guidelines. Conversely, the helpfulness of a response is assessed based on its clarity, relevance, and quality, which is considered distinct from its harmlessness. The two-dimensional ranking of responses enriches the understanding of language model outputs, balancing generation quality and instruction-following with safety considerations. # A.2 DATA GENERATION Figure 3a provides an overview of the data utilized for the iterative refinement of both reward and cost models. In each iteration, data are generated via the most recent RLHF model available. Prompts are predominantly sourced from the works of Ganguli et al. (2022) and Ji et al. (2023). Notably, in Rounds 2 and 3, we incorporate a limited subset of red-team prompts crafted explicitly by our research team to attack the latest RLHF model. To generate responses to these prompts, we randomly sample from the RLHF models using the following parameter settings: temperature = {0.001, 0.5, 1.0, 1.2}, top-K = 50, and top-p = 0.95.

A.4 ANNOTATION DOCUMENTS In our preliminary consultations with the data annotation team, we discovered that crowdworkers may encounter challenges in comprehending artificially decoupled preference dimensions. We have developed two annotation guides to facilitate better alignment between the crowdworkers and the research team. The first guide focuses on the classification of harm categories and offers a range of examples to enhance understanding. The second guide pertains to preference annotation, explaining the distinctions between ranking helpfulness and harmlessness in a given QA pair. Our guides are similarly developed based on the annotation documents in Section D of Ji et al. (2023). A.5 DATA ANNOTATION TEAM Crowdworker Recruitment For this project, we chose to partner with a local data annotation firm, hereafter referred to as our â data partnerâ to maintain anonymity during the double-blinded review process. This entity assumes direct responsibility for crowdworkers recruitment and man- agement. Leveraging their expertise in their previous text annotation projects, our data partner as- sembled a team of skilled annotators aligned with our project requirements. Each selected annotator was required to demonstrate high proficiency in English and undergo a rigorous evaluation process, which requires achieving a minimum accuracy of 90% when compared to answer keys provided by our research team. Out of an initial candidate pool of approximately 200, we ultimately retained 70 annotators who successfully cleared this assessment phase. Although we initially considered utilizing major international platforms like Amazon MTurk and Upwork, we opted for our current partnership to secure more tangible oversight over the entire process, including legal agreements and face-to-face meetings, thereby bolstering the projectâ s likelihood of success. Task Assignment, Annotation Collection, and Quality Control The quality control (QC) pro- cess involves three key stakeholders: the crowdworkers, the QC team of the data partner, and our research team. The data partner is responsible for task allocation, the collection of completed as- signments, and worker training.'),\n",

This review is conducted in accordance with the stan- dards provided by our research team. Subsequently, the reviewed batch is sent to our research team for additional quality evaluation. As per our agreed criteria, the research team must sample at least 10% of the data from each reviewed batch, and the percentage agreement must meet or exceed 90% for the batch to be accepted. This threshold was set, recognizing that attaining a 100% agreement rate is neither realistically achievable nor financially sustainable for the annotation service. More- over, aiming for absolute agreement risks introducing additional biases from the research team. For a batch to be officially rejected, at least two research team members must approve the rejection.'),\n",

(2022). The RLHF training objective consists of two parts: the RL objective and the PTX pretraining objective. The reward function used in the RL training is the reward model output with an extra per-token KL penalty. Given a prompt x â ¼ Dprompt, we use the current actor model Ï Î¸(y|x) to generate a corresponding response y = a1:T with length T . When the reward for tokens a1:T is defined as: RM 0, 1<t<T, ~RM _ 15 \" Uietva) t=T, (15) rKL t = â log Ï Î¸(at|x, a1:tâ 1) Ï ref(at|x, a1:tâ 1) , (1 â ¤ t â ¤ T ), (16) Ë rt = rRM t + Î²rKL t , (1 â ¤ t â ¤ T ), (17) where Ï ref(Â·|x) is the reference model and Î² â ¥ 0 is the KL panelty coefficient. For each token, there is a dense reward panelized by the KL divergence between the current actor model and the reference model. The reward model (RM) only outputs a sparse reward on the last token. The reference model is a frozen LLM with the initial actor model parameters at the beginning of the RLHF phase. For instance, the reference model is the SFT model (i.e., Alpaca-7B (Taori et al., 2023)) in the first iteration of RLHF. Then in the second iteration of RLHF, the reference model is the RLHF fine-tuned model in the first iteration. In the RLHF fine-tuning phase, we use the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm (Schul- man et al., 2017) to train the LLM. The surrogate PPO clip loss for the RL training objective is formulated as:'),\n",

For every token, at\\neach layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state\\nand combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the\\nselected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has\\naccess to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference.\\nMixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or\\nmatches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular,\\nMixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and\\nmultilingual benchmarks.
